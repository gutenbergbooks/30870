<h4><i>TO CHARLES BAXTER</i></h4>

<h5><i>WRITER TO THE SIGNET</i></h5>

<p><i>My dear Charles,</i></p>

<p style="text-indent: 5em;"><i>It is the fate of sequels to disappoint those who have
waited for them; and my David, having been left to kick his
heels for more than a lustre in the British Linen Company&rsquo;s
office, must expect his late re-appearance to be greeted with
hoots, if not with missiles. Yet, when I remember the days
of our explorations, I am not without hope. There should be
left in our native city some seed of the elect; some long-legged,
hot-headed youth must repeat to-day our dreams and wanderings
of so many years ago; he will relish the pleasure, which
should have been ours, to follow among named streets and
numbered houses the country walks of David Balfour, to
identify Dean, and Silvermills, and Broughton, and Hope
Park, and Pilrig, and poor old Lochend&mdash;if it still be standing,
and the Figgate Whins&mdash;if there be any of them left; or to
push (on a long holiday) so far afield as Gillane or the Bass.
So, perhaps, his eye shall be opened to behold the series of the
generations, and he shall weigh with surprise his momentous
and nugatory gift of life.</i></p>

<p><i>You are still&mdash;as when first I saw, as when I last addressed
you&mdash;in the venerable city which I must always think of as my
home. And I have come so far; and the sights and thoughts
of my youth pursue me; and I see like a vision the youth of
my father, and of his father, and the whole stream of lives flowing
down there far in the north, with the sound of laughter and
tears, to cast me out in the end, as by a sudden freshet, on these
ultimate islands. And I admire and bow my head before
the romance of destiny.</i></p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h5>A BEGGAR ON HORSEBACK</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> 25th day of August, 1751, about two in the afternoon,
I, David Balfour, came forth of the British Linen Company,
a porter attending me with a bag of money, and some of
the chief of these merchants bowing me from their doors.
Two days before, and even so late as yestermorning, I was
like a beggarman by the wayside, clad in rags, brought
down to my last shillings, my companion a condemned
traitor, a price set on my own head for a crime with the news
of which the country rang. To-day I was served heir to
my position in life, a landed laird, a bank-porter by me
carrying my gold, recommendations in my pocket, and (in
the words of the saying) the ball directly at my foot.</p>

<p>There were two circumstances that served me as ballast
to so much sail. The first was the very difficult and deadly
business I had still to handle; the second, the place that I
was in. The tall, black city, and the numbers and movement
and noise of so many folk, made a new world for me,
after the moorland braes, the sea-sands, and the still country-sides
that I had frequented up to then. The throng of the
citizens in particular abashed me. Rankeillor&rsquo;s son was
short and small in the girth; his clothes scarce held on me;
and it was plain I was ill qualified to strut in the front of
a bank-porter. It was plain, if I did so, I should but set
folk laughing, and (what was worse in my case) set them
asking questions. So that I behoved to come by some
clothes of my own, and in the meanwhile to walk by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8"></a>8</span>
porter&rsquo;s side, and put my hand on his arm as though we
were a pair of friends.</p>

<p>At a merchant&rsquo;s in the Luckenbooths I had myself
fitted out: none too fine, for I had no idea to appear like a
beggar on horseback; but comely and responsible, so that
servants should respect me. Thence to an armourer&rsquo;s,
where I got a plain sword, to suit with my degree in life.
I felt safer with the weapon, though (for one so ignorant of
defence) it might be called an added danger. The porter,
who was naturally a man of some experience, judged my
accoutrement to be well chosen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naething kenspeckle,&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_1" href="#Footnote_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a> said he; &ldquo;plain, dacent claes.
As for the rapier, nae doubt it sits wi&rsquo; your degree; but an
I had been you, I would hae waired my siller better gates
than that.&rdquo; And he proposed I should buy winter hosen
from a wife in the Cowgate-back, that was a cousin of his
own, and made them &ldquo;extraordinar endurable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But I had other matters on my hand more pressing. Here
I was in this old, black city, which was for all the world like
a rabbit-warren, not only by the number of its indwellers,
but the complication of its passages and holes. It was indeed
a place where no stranger had a chance to find a friend,
let be another stranger. Suppose him even to hit on the
right close, people dwelt so thronged in these tall houses,
he might very well seek a day before he chanced on the
right door. The ordinary course was to hire a lad they
called a <i>caddie</i>, who was like a guide or pilot, led you where
you had occasion, and (your errands being done) brought
you again where you were lodging. But these caddies,
being always employed in the same sort of services, and
having it for obligation to be well informed of every house
and person in the city, had grown to form a brotherhood
of spies; and I knew from tales of Mr. Campbell&rsquo;s how they
communicated one with another, what a rage of curiosity
they conceived as to their employer&rsquo;s business, and how
they were like eyes and fingers to the police. It would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9"></a>9</span>
a piece of little wisdom, the way I was now placed, to tack
such a ferret to my tails. I had three visits to make, all
immediately needful: to my kinsman Mr. Balfour of Pilrig,
to Stewart the Writer that was Appin&rsquo;s agent, and to
William Grant, Esquire of Prestongrange, Lord Advocate
of Scotland. Mr. Balfour&rsquo;s was a non-committal visit;
and besides (Pilrig being in the country) I made bold to
find the way to it myself, with the help of my two legs and
a Scots tongue. But the rest were in a different case. Not
only was the visit to Appin&rsquo;s agent, in the midst of the cry
about the Appin murder, dangerous in itself, but it was
highly inconsistent with the other. I was like to have a
bad enough time of it with my Lord Advocate Grant, the
best of ways; but to go to him hot-foot from Appin&rsquo;s agent
was little likely to mend my own affairs, and might prove
the mere ruin of friend Alan&rsquo;s. The whole thing, besides,
gave me a look of running with the hare and hunting with
the hounds that was little to my fancy. I determined,
therefore, to be done at once with Mr. Stewart and the whole
Jacobitical side of my business, and to profit for that purpose
by the guidance of the porter at my side. But it
chanced I had scarce given him the address, when there
came a sprinkle of rain&mdash;nothing to hurt, only for my new
clothes&mdash;and we took shelter under a pend at the head of
a close or alley.</p>

<p>Being strange to what I saw, I stepped a little farther
in. The narrow paved way descended swiftly. Prodigious
tall houses sprang up on each side and bulged out, one
story beyond another, as they rose. At the top only a
ribbon of sky showed in. By what I could spy in the
windows, and by the respectable persons that passed out
and in, I saw the houses to be very well occupied; and the
whole appearance of the place interested me like a tale.</p>

<p>I was still gazing, when there came a sudden brisk
tramp of feet in time and clash of steel behind me. Turning
quickly, I was aware of a party of armed soldiers, and,
in their midst, a tall man in a great-coat. He walked with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"></a>10</span>
a stoop that was like a piece of courtesy, genteel and insinuating:
he waved his hands plausibly as he went, and
his face was sly and handsome. I thought his eye took
me in, but could not meet it. This procession went by
to a door in the close, which a serving-man in a fine livery
set open; and two of the soldier-lads carried the prisoner
within, the rest lingering with their firelocks by the door.</p>

<p>There can nothing pass in the streets of a city without
some following of idle folk and children. It was so now;
but the more part melted away incontinent until but three
were left. One was a girl; she was dressed like a lady, and
had a screen of the Drummond colours on her head; but
her comrades or (I should say) followers were ragged gillies,
such as I had seen the matches of by the dozen in my Highland
journey. They all spoke together earnestly in Gaelic,
the sound of which was pleasant in my ears for the sake of
Alan; and though the rain was by again, and my porter
plucked at me to be going, I even drew nearer where
they were, to listen. The lady scolded sharply, the others
making apologies and cringing before her, so that I made
sure she was come of a chief&rsquo;s house. All the while the
three of them sought in their pockets, and by what I could
make out, they had the matter of half a farthing among
the party; which made me smile a little to see all Highland
folk alike for fine obeisances and empty sporrans.</p>

<p>It chanced the girl turned suddenly about, so that I
saw her face for the first time. There is no greater wonder
than the way the face of a young woman fits in a man&rsquo;s
mind, and stays there, and he could never tell you why;
it just seems it was the thing he wanted. She had wonderful
bright eyes like stars, and I daresay the eyes had a part
in it; but what I remember the most clearly was the way
her lips were a trifle open as she turned. And whatever
was the cause, I stood there staring like a fool. On her
side, as she had not known there was any one so near, she
looked at me a little longer, and perhaps with more surprise,
than was entirely civil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"></a>11</span></p>

<p>It went through my country head she might be wondering
at my new clothes; with that I blushed to my hair, and
at the sight of my colouring it is to be supposed she drew
her own conclusions, for she moved her gillies farther down
the close, and they fell again to this dispute where I could
hear no more of it.</p>

<p>I had often admired a lassie before then, if scarce so
sudden and strong; and it was rather my disposition to
withdraw than to come forward, for I was much in fear of
mockery from the womenkind. You would have thought
I had now all the more reason to pursue my common
practice, since I had met this young lady in the city street,
seemingly following a prisoner, and accompanied with two
very ragged indecent-like Highlandmen. But there was
here a different ingredient; it was plain the girl thought I
had been prying in her secrets; and with my new clothes
and sword, and at the top of my new fortunes, this was
more than I could swallow. The beggar on horseback could
not bear to be thrust down so low, or, at the least of it, not
by this young lady.</p>

<p>I followed, accordingly, and took off my new hat to her,
the best that I was able.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I think it only fair to myself to
let you understand I have no Gaelic. It is true I was
listening, for I have friends of my own across the Highland
line, and the sound of that tongue comes friendly; but,
for your private affairs, if you had spoken Greek, I might
have had more guess at them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She made me a little, distant curtsey. &ldquo;There is no
harm done,&rdquo; she said, with a pretty accent, most like the
English (but more agreeable). &ldquo;A cat may look at a king.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not mean to offend,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I have no skill
of city manners; I never before this day set foot inside the
doors of Edinburgh. Take me for a country lad&mdash;it&rsquo;s what I
am; and I would rather I told you than you found it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, it will be a very unusual thing for strangers
to be speaking to each other on the causeway,&rdquo; she replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"></a>12</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But if you are landward<a name="FnAnchor_2" href="#Footnote_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a> bred it will be different. I am
as landward as yourself; I am Highland, as you see, and
think myself the farther from my home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not yet a week since I passed the line,&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;Less than a week ago I was on the braes of Balquhidder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Balwhither?&rdquo; she cries. &ldquo;Come ye from Balwhither?
The name of it makes all there is of me rejoice. You will
not have been long there, and not known some of our friends
or family?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I lived with a very honest, kind man called Duncan
Dhu Maclaren,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I know Duncan, and you give him the true
name!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and if he is an honest man, his wife is
honest indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;they are fine people, and the place is a
bonny place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where in the great world is such another?&rdquo; she cries;
&ldquo;I am loving the smell of that place and the roots that grow
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was infinitely taken with the spirit of the maid. &ldquo;I
could be wishing I had brought you a spray of that heather,&rdquo;
says I. &ldquo;And though I did ill to speak with you at the
first, now it seems we have common acquaintance, I make
it my petition you will not forget me. David Balfour is
the name I am known by. This is my lucky day, when I
have just come into a landed estate, and am not very long
out of a deadly peril, I wish you would keep my name
in mind for the sake of Balquhidder,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I will
yours for the sake of my lucky day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is not spoken,&rdquo; she replied, with a great deal
of haughtiness. &ldquo;More than a hundred years it has not
gone upon men&rsquo;s tongues, save for a blink. I am nameless,
like the Folk of Peace.<a name="FnAnchor_3" href="#Footnote_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a> Catriona Drummond is the one
I use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now indeed I knew where I was standing. In all broad
Scotland there was but the one name proscribed, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"></a>13</span>
was the name of the Macgregors. Yet so far from fleeing
this undesirable acquaintancy, I plunged the deeper in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been sitting with one who was in the same case
with yourself,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I think he will be one of your
friends. They called him Robin Oig.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did ye so?&rdquo; cries she. &ldquo;Ye met Rob?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I passed the night with him,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a fowl of the night,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a set of pipes there,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;so you
may judge if the time passed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should be no enemy, at all events,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;That was his brother there a moment since, with the red
soldiers round him. It is him that I call father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it so?&rdquo; cried I. &ldquo;Are you a daughter of James
More&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the daughter that he has,&rdquo; says she: &ldquo;the daughter
of a prisoner; that I should forget it so, even for one hour,
to talk with strangers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here one of the gillies addressed her in what he had of
English, to know what &ldquo;she&rdquo; (meaning by that himself)
was to do about &ldquo;ta sneeshin.&rdquo; I took some note of him
for a short, bandy-legged, red-haired, big-headed man, that
I was to know more of, to my cost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There can be none the day, Neil,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;How
will you get &lsquo;sneeshin&rsquo; wanting siller? It will teach you
another time to be more careful; and I think James More
will not be very well pleased with Neil of the Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Drummond,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I told you I was in my
lucky day. Here I am, and a bank-porter at my tail. And
remember I have had the hospitality of your own country
of Balquhidder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not one of my people gave it,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I am owing your uncle at least
for some springs upon the pipes. Besides which, I have
offered myself to be your friend, and you have been so forgetful
that you did not refuse me in the proper time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it had been a great sum, it might have done you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"></a>14</span>
honour,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;but I will tell you what this is. James
More lies shackled in prison; but this time past, they will
be bringing him down here daily to the Advocate&rsquo;s....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Advocate&rsquo;s?&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Is that...?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the house of the Lord Advocate Grant of Prestongrange,&rdquo;
said she. &ldquo;There they bring my father one time
and another, for what purpose I have no thought in my
mind; but it seems there is some hope dawned for him.
All this same time they will not let me be seeing him, nor
yet him write; and we wait upon the King&rsquo;s street to catch
him; and now we give him his snuff as he goes by, and now
something else. And here is this son of trouble, Neil, son
of Duncan, has lost my fourpenny-piece that was to buy
that snuff, and James More must go wanting, and will think
his daughter has forgotten him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I took sixpence from my pocket, gave it to Neil, and
bade him go about his errand. Then to her, &ldquo;That sixpence
came with me by Balquhidder,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you are a friend to the Gregara!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not like to deceive you either,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I
know very little of the Gregara and less of James More and
his doings, but since the while I have been standing in this
close, I seem to know something of yourself; and if you will
just say &lsquo;a friend to Miss Catriona&rsquo; I will see you are the
less cheated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The one cannot be without the other,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will even try,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what will you be thinking of myself?&rdquo; she cried,
&ldquo;to be holding my hand to the first stranger!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am thinking nothing but that you are a good
daughter,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must not be without repaying it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Where
is it you stop?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To tell the truth, I am stopping nowhere yet,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;being not full three hours in the city; but if you will
give me your direction, I will be so bold as come seeking
my sixpence for myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"></a>15</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Will I can trust you for that?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need have little fear,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;James More could not bear it else,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I
stop beyond the village of Dean, on the north side of the
water, with Mrs. Drummond-Ogilvy of Allardyce, who is
my near friend and will be glad to thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are to see me then, so soon as what I have to do
permits,&rdquo; said I; and, the remembrance of Alan rolling
in again upon my mind, I made haste to say farewell.</p>

<p>I could not but think, even as I did so, that we had
made extraordinary free upon short acquaintance, and that
a really wise young lady would have shown herself more
backward. I think it was the bank-porter that put me
from this ungallant train of thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thoucht ye had been a lad of some kind o&rsquo; sense,&rdquo;
he began, shooting out his lips. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re no&rsquo; likely to gang
far this gate. A fule and his siller&rsquo;s shune parted. Eh,
but ye&rsquo;re a green callant!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;an&rsquo; a veecious, tae!
Cleikin&rsquo; up wi&rsquo; baubee-joes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you dare to speak of the young lady ...&rdquo; I
began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leddy!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Haud us and safe us, whatten
leddy? Ca&rsquo; <i>thon</i> a leddy? The toun&rsquo;s fu&rsquo; o&rsquo; them.
Leddies! Man, it&rsquo;s weel seen ye&rsquo;re no very acquaint in
Embro!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A clap of anger took me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;lead me where I told you, and keep
your foul mouth shut!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not wholly obey me, for though he no more
addressed me directly, he sang at me as he went in a very
impudent manner of innuendo, and with an exceedingly
ill voice and ear&mdash;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h5>THE HIGHLAND WRITER</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Mr. Charles Stewart</span> the Writer dwelt at the top of the
longest stair that ever mason set a hand to; fifteen flights
of it, no less; and when I had come to his door, and a
clerk had opened it, and told me his master was within, I
had scarce breath enough to send my porter packing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Awa&rsquo; east and wast wi&rsquo; ye!&rdquo; said I, took the moneybag
out of his hands, and followed the clerk in.</p>

<p>The outer room was an office with the clerk&rsquo;s chair
at a table spread with law-papers. In the inner chamber,
which opened from it, a little brisk man sat poring on
a deed, from which he scarce raised his eyes upon my
entrance; indeed, he still kept his finger in the place, as
though prepared to show me out and fall again to his
studies. This pleased me little enough; and, what pleased
me less, I thought the clerk was in a good posture to overhear
what should pass between us.</p>

<p>I asked if he was Mr. Charles Stewart the Writer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The same,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;and if the question is equally
fair, who may you be yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never heard tell of my name nor of me either,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;but I bring you a token from a friend that you
know well. That you know well,&rdquo; I repeated, lowering
my voice, &ldquo;but maybe are not just so keen to hear from
at this present being. And the bits of business that I have
to propone to you are rather in the nature of being confidential.
In short, I would like to think we were quite
private.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rose without more words, casting down his paper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"></a>17</span>
like a man ill-pleased, sent forth his clerk of an errand,
and shut-to the house-door behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, sir,&rdquo; said he, returning, &ldquo;speak out your mind
and fear nothing; though before you begin,&rdquo; he cries out,
&ldquo;I tell you mine misgives me! I tell you beforehand,
ye&rsquo;re either a Stewart or a Stewart sent ye. A good name
it is, and one it would ill become my father&rsquo;s son to lightly.
But I begin to grue at the sound of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is called Balfour,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;David Balfour
of Shaws. As for him that sent me, I will let his token
speak.&rdquo; And I showed the silver button.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put it in your pocket, sir!&rdquo; cries he. &ldquo;Ye need
name no names. The deevil&rsquo;s buckie, I ken the button
of him! And deil hae&rsquo;t! Where is he now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told him I knew not where Alan was, but he had
some sure place (or thought he had) about the north side,
where he was to lie until a ship was found for him; and
how and where he had appointed to be spoken with.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been always my opinion that I would hang in a
tow for this family of mine,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and, dod! I believe
the day&rsquo;s come now! Get a ship for him, quot&rsquo; he! And
who&rsquo;s to pay for it? The man&rsquo;s daft!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is my part of the affair, Mr. Stewart,&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;Here is a bag of good money, and if more be wanted,
more is to be had where it came from.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I needn&rsquo;t ask your politics,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye need not,&rdquo; said I, smiling, &ldquo;for I am as big a Whig
as grows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop a bit, stop a bit,&rdquo; says Mr. Stewart. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
all this? A Whig? Then why are you here with Alan&rsquo;s
button? and what kind of a black-foot traffic is this that
I find ye out in, Mr. Whig? Here is a forfeited rebel and
an accused murderer, with two hundred pounds on his life,
and ye ask me to meddle in his business, and then tell me
ye&rsquo;re a Whig! I have no mind of any such Whigs before,
though I&rsquo;ve kennt plenty of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a forfeited rebel, and more&rsquo;s the pity,&rdquo; said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18"></a>18</span>
I, &ldquo;for the man&rsquo;s my friend. I can only wish he had
been better guided. And an accused murderer, that he
is too, for his misfortune; but wrongfully accused.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear you say so,&rdquo; said Stewart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than you are to hear me say so, before long,&rdquo;
said I. &ldquo;Alan Breck is innocent, and so is James.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;the two cases hang together. If
Alan is out, James can never be in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hereupon I told him briefly of my acquaintance with
Alan, of the accident that brought me present at the Appin
murder, and the various passages of our escape among the
heather, and my recovery of my estate. &ldquo;So, sir, you have
now the whole train of these events,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;and can
see for yourself how I come to be so much mingled up with
the affairs of your family and friends, which (for all of our
sakes) I wish had been plainer and less bloody. You can see
for yourself, too, that I have certain pieces of business
depending, which were scarcely fit to lay before a lawyer
chosen at random. No more remains, but to ask if you will
undertake my service?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no great mind to it; but coming as you do
with Alan&rsquo;s button, the choice is scarcely left me,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;What are your instructions?&rdquo; he added, and took up his
pen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first point is to smuggle Alan forth of this
country,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I need not be repeating that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am little likely to forget it,&rdquo; said Stewart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next thing is the bit money I am owing to Cluny,&rdquo;
I went on. &ldquo;It would be ill for me to find a conveyance,
but that should be no stick to you. It was two pounds
five shillings and three-halfpence farthing sterling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He noted it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a Mr. Henderland, a licensed
preacher and missionary in Ardgour, that I would like
well to get some snuff into the hands of; and as I daresay
you keep touch with your friends in Appin (so near by), it&rsquo;s
a job you could doubtless overtake with the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"></a>19</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How much snuff are we to say?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of two pounds,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s the lass Alison Hastie, in Limekilns,&rdquo;
said I. &ldquo;Her that helped Alan and me across the Forth.
I was thinking if I could get her a good Sunday gown,
such as she could wear with decency in her degree, it would
be an ease to my conscience; for the mere truth is, we owe
her our two lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad to see you are thrifty, Mr. Balfour,&rdquo; says
he, making his notes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would think shame to be otherwise the first day
of my fortune,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;And now, if you will compute
the outlay and your own proper charges, I would be glad
to know if I could get some spending-money back. It&rsquo;s
not that I grudge the whole of it to get Alan safe; it&rsquo;s not
that I lack more; but having drawn so much the one day,
I think it would have a very ill appearance if I was back
again seeking the next. Only be sure you have enough,&rdquo;
I added, &ldquo;for I am very undesirous to meet with you
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and I&rsquo;m pleased to see you&rsquo;re cautious too,&rdquo;
said the Writer. &ldquo;But I think ye take a risk to lay so
considerable a sum at my discretion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said this with a plain sneer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to run the hazard,&rdquo; I replied.&mdash;&ldquo;O, and
there&rsquo;s another service I would ask, and that&rsquo;s to direct
me to a lodging, for I have no roof to my head. But
it must be a lodging I may seem to have hit upon by
accident, for it would never do if the Lord Advocate were
to get any jealousy of our acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye may set your weary spirit at rest,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I
will never name your name, sir; and it&rsquo;s my belief the
Advocate is still so much to be sympathised with that he
doesna ken of your existence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I saw I had got to the wrong side of the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a braw day coming for him, then,&rdquo; said I,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20"></a>20</span>
&ldquo;for he&rsquo;ll have to learn of it on the deaf side of his head
no later than to-morrow, when I call on him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When ye <i>call</i> on him!&rdquo; repeated Mr. Stewart. &ldquo;Am
I daft, or are you? What takes ye near the Advocate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, just to give myself up,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Balfour,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;are ye making a mock of
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;though I think you have allowed
yourself some such freedom with myself. But I give you
to understand once and for all that I am in no jesting spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor yet me,&rdquo; says Stewart. &ldquo;And I give you to
understand (if that&rsquo;s to be the word) that I like the looks
of your behaviour less and less. You come here to me
with all sorts of propositions, which will put me in a train
of very doubtful acts, and bring me among very undesirable
persons this many a day to come. And then you tell me
you&rsquo;re going straight out of my office to make your peace
with the Advocate! Alan&rsquo;s button here or Alan&rsquo;s button
there, the four quarters of Alan wouldna bribe me further
in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would take it with a little more temper,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;and perhaps we can avoid what you object to. I can
see no way for it but to give myself up, but perhaps you
can see another; and if you could, I could never deny
but what I would be rather relieved. For I think my
traffic with his lordship is little likely to agree with my
health. There&rsquo;s just the one thing clear, that I have to
give my evidence; for I hope it&rsquo;ll save Alan&rsquo;s character
(what&rsquo;s left of it), and James&rsquo;s neck, which is the more
immediate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was silent for a breathing-space, and then, &ldquo;My
man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll never be allowed to give such
evidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to see about that,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m stiff-necked
when I like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye muckle ass!&rdquo; cried Stewart, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s James they
want; James has got to hang&mdash;Alan too, if they could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"></a>21</span>
catch him&mdash;but James whatever! Go near the Advocate
with any such business, and you&rsquo;ll see! he&rsquo;ll find a way
to muzzle ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think better of the Advocate than that,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Advocate be damned!&rdquo; cries he. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
Campbells, man! You&rsquo;ll have the whole clanjamfry of
them on your back; and so will the Advocate too, poor
body! It&rsquo;s extraordinar ye cannot see where ye stand!
If there&rsquo;s no fair way to stop your gab, there&rsquo;s a foul one
gaping. They can put ye in the dock, do ye no&rsquo; see that?&rdquo;
he cried, and stabbed me with one finger in the leg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I was told that same no further back
than this morning by another lawyer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who was he?&rdquo; asked Stewart. &ldquo;He spoke
sense at least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told him I must be excused from naming him, for he
was a decent stout old Whig, and had little mind to be
mixed up in such affairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think all the world seems to be mixed up in it!&rdquo;
cries Stewart. &ldquo;But what said you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told him what had passed between Rankeillor and
myself before the house of Shaws.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and so ye will hang!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll hang
beside James Stewart. There&rsquo;s your fortune told.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope better of it yet than that,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but I
could never deny there was a risk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Risk!&rdquo; says he, and then sat silent again. &ldquo;I
ought to thank you for your staunchness to my friends,
to whom you show a very good spirit,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;if you
have the strength to stand by it. But I warn you that
you&rsquo;re wading deep. I wouldn&rsquo;t put myself in your place
(me that&rsquo;s a Stewart born!) for all the Stewarts that ever
there were since Noah. Risk? ay, I take over-many:
but to be tried in court before a Campbell jury and a
Campbell judge, and that in a Campbell country, and upon
a Campbell quarrel&mdash;think what you like of me, Balfour,
it&rsquo;s beyond me.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"></a>22</span>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a different way of thinking, I suppose,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;I was brought up to this one by my father before me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glory to his bones! he has left a decent son to his
name,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Yet I would not have you judge me
over-sorely. My case is dooms hard. See, sir, ye tell
me ye&rsquo;re a Whig: I wonder what I am. No Whig, to
be sure; I couldna be just that. But&mdash;laigh in your ear,
man&mdash;I&rsquo;m maybe no&rsquo; very keen on the other side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that a fact?&rdquo; cried I. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what I would think
of a man of your intelligence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hoot I none of your whillywhas!&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_4" href="#Footnote_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a> cries he. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
intelligence upon both sides. But for my private part I
have no particular desire to harm King George; and as
for King James, God bless him! he does very well for me
across the water. I&rsquo;m a lawyer, ye see: fond of my books
and my bottle, a good plea, a well-drawn deed, a crack
in the Parliament House with other lawyer bodies, and
perhaps a turn at the golf on a Saturday at e&rsquo;en. Where
do ye come in with your Hieland plaids and claymores?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a fact ye have little of the wild
Highlandman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little?&rdquo; quoth he. &ldquo;Nothing, man! And yet I&rsquo;m
Hieland born, and when the clan pipes, who but me
has to dance? The clan and the name, that goes by all.
It&rsquo;s just what you said yourself; my father learned it to
me, and a bonny trade I have of it. Treason and traitors,
and the smuggling of them out and in; and the French
recruiting, weary fall it! and the smuggling through of
the recruits; and their pleas&mdash;a sorrow of their pleas!
Here have I been moving one for young Ardshiel, my
cousin; claimed the estate under the marriage contract&mdash;a
forfeited estate! I told them it was nonsense; muckle
they cared! And there was I cocking behind a yadvocate
that liked the business as little as myself, for it was fair ruin
to the pair of us&mdash;a black mark, <i>disaffected</i>, branded on
our hurdles like folk&rsquo;s names upon their kye! And what can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"></a>23</span>
I do? I&rsquo;m a Stewart, ye see, and must fend for my clan
and family. Then no later by than yesterday there was
one of our Stewart lads carried to the Castle. What for?
I ken fine: Act of 1736: recruiting for King Lewie. And
you&rsquo;ll see, he&rsquo;ll whistle me in to be his lawyer, and there&rsquo;ll
be another black mark on my chara&rsquo;ter! I tell you fair:
if I but kennt the heid of a Hebrew word from the hurdies
of it, be damned but I would fling the whole thing up and
turn minister!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather a hard position,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dooms hard!&rdquo; cries he. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what makes
me think so much of ye&mdash;you that&rsquo;s no Stewart&mdash;to stick
your head so deep in Stewart business. And for what,
I do not know: unless it was the sense of duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope it will be that,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a grand quality.&mdash;But here
is my clerk back; and, by your leave, we&rsquo;ll pick a bit of
dinner, all the three of us. When that&rsquo;s done, I&rsquo;ll give
you the direction of a very decent man, that&rsquo;ll be very
fain to have you for a lodger. And I&rsquo;ll fill your pockets
to ye, forbye, out of your ain bag. For this business&rsquo;ll
not be near as dear as ye suppose&mdash;not even the ship
part of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I made him a sign that his clerk was within hearing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hoot, ye needna mind for Robbie,&rdquo; cries he. &ldquo;A
Stewart too, puir deevil! and has smuggled out more French
recruits and trafficking Papists than what he has hairs upon
his face. Why, it&rsquo;s Robin that manages that branch of my
affairs.&mdash;Who will we have now, Rob, for across the water?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be Andie Scougal, in the <i>Thristle</i>,&rdquo; replied
Rob. &ldquo;I saw Hoseason the other day, but it seems he&rsquo;s
wanting the ship. Then there&rsquo;ll be Tam Stobo; but I&rsquo;m
none so sure of Tam. I&rsquo;ve seen him colloguing with some
gey queer acquaintances; and if it was anybody important,
I would give Tam the go-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The head&rsquo;s worth two hundred pounds, Robin,&rdquo;
said Stewart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"></a>24</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Gosh, that&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; be Alan Breck?&rdquo; cried the clerk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just Alan,&rdquo; said his master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weary winds! that&rsquo;s sayrious,&rdquo; cried Robin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
try Andie, then; Andie&rsquo;ll be the best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems it&rsquo;s quite a big business,&rdquo; I observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Balfour, there&rsquo;s no end to it,&rdquo; said Stewart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a name your clerk mentioned,&rdquo; I went
on: &ldquo;Hoseason. That must be my man, I think: Hoseason,
of the brig <i>Covenant</i>. Would you set your trust on him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He didna behave very well to you and Alan,&rdquo; said
Mr. Stewart; &ldquo;but my mind of the man in general is
rather otherwise. If he had taken Alan on board his ship
on an agreement, it&rsquo;s my notion he would have proved a
just dealer.&mdash;How say ye, Rob?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more honest skipper in the trade than Eli,&rdquo; said
the clerk. &ldquo;I would lippen to<a name="FnAnchor_5" href="#Footnote_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a> Eli&rsquo;s word&mdash;ay, if it was
the Chevalier, or Appin himsel&rsquo;,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it was him that brought the doctor, wasna&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
asked the master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was the very man,&rdquo; said the clerk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I think he took the doctor back?&rdquo; says Stewart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, with his sporran full!&rdquo; cried Robin. &ldquo;And
Eli kennt of that!&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_6" href="#Footnote_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it seems it&rsquo;s hard to ken folk rightly,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was just what I forgot when ye came in, Mr.
Balfour!&rdquo; says the Writer.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h5>I GO TO PILRIG</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> next morning I was no sooner awake in my new
lodging than I was up and into my new clothes; and
no sooner the breakfast swallowed, than I was forth on
my adventures. Alan, I could hope, was fended for;
James was like to be a more difficult affair, and I could
not but think that enterprise might cost me dear, even
as everybody said to whom I had opened my opinion.
It seemed I was come to the top of the mountain only to
cast myself down; that I had clambered up, through so
many and hard trials, to be rich, to be recognised, to wear
city clothes and a sword to my side, all to commit mere
suicide at the last end of it, and the worst kind of suicide
besides, which is to get hanged at the King&rsquo;s charges.</p>

<p>What was I doing it for? I asked, as I went down
the High Street and out north by Leith Wynd. First
I said it was to save James Stewart; and no doubt the
memory of his distress and his wife&rsquo;s cries, and a word or
so I had let drop on that occasion worked upon me strongly.
At the same time I reflected that it was (or ought to be) the
most indifferent matter to my father&rsquo;s son, whether James
died in his bed or from a scaffold. He was Alan&rsquo;s cousin,
to be sure; but, so far as regarded Alan, the best thing
would be to lie low, and let the King, and his Grace of
Argyle, and the corbie-crows, pick the bones of his kinsman
their own way. Nor could I forget that, while we were all
in the pot together, James had shown no such particular
anxiety whether for Alan or me.</p>

<p>Next it came upon me I was acting for the sake of justice:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26"></a>26</span>
and I thought that a fine word, and reasoned it out that
(since we dwelt in polities, at some discomfort to each one
of us) the main thing of all must still be justice, and the
death of any innocent man a wound upon the whole community.
Next, again, it was the Accuser of the Brethren
that gave me a turn of his argument; bade me think shame
for pretending myself concerned in these high matters,
and told me I was but a prating vain child, who had spoken
big words to Rankeillor and to Stewart, and held myself
bound upon my vanity to make good that boastfulness.
Nay, and he hit me with the other end of the stick; for
he accused me of a kind of artful cowardice, going about
at the expense of a little risk to purchase greater safety.
No doubt, until I had declared and cleared myself, I might
any day encounter Mungo Campbell or the sheriff&rsquo;s officer,
and be recognised, and dragged into the Appin murder
by the heels; and, no doubt, in case I could manage my
declaration with success, I should breathe more free for
ever after. But when I looked this argument full in the
face I could see nothing to be ashamed of. As for the rest,
&ldquo;Here are the two roads,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;and both go to the
same place. It&rsquo;s unjust that James should hang if I can
save him; and it would be ridiculous in me to have talked
so much and then do nothing. It&rsquo;s lucky for James of
the Glens that I have boasted beforehand; and none so
unlucky for myself, because now I&rsquo;m committed to do right.
I have the name of a gentleman and the means of one; it
would be a poor discovery that I was wanting in the essence.&rdquo;
And then I thought this was a Pagan spirit, and said a
prayer in to myself, asking for what courage I might lack,
and that I might go straight to my duty like a soldier to
battle, and come off again scatheless, as so many do.</p>

<p>This train of reasoning brought me to a more resolved
complexion; though it was far from closing up my sense of
the dangers that surrounded me, nor of how very apt I was
(if I went on) to stumble on the ladder of the gallows. It
was a plain fair morning, but the wind in the east. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"></a>27</span>
little chill of it sang in my blood, and gave me a feeling of
the autumn, and the dead leaves, and dead folk&rsquo;s bodies in
their graves. It seemed the devil was in it, if I was to die
in that tide of my fortunes and for other folk&rsquo;s affairs. On
the top of the Calton Hill, though it was not the customary
time of year for that diversion, some children were crying
and running with their kites. These toys appeared very
plain against the sky; I remarked a great one soar on
the wind to a high altitude and then plump among the
whins; and I thought to myself at sight of it, &ldquo;There goes
Davie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My way lay over Mouter&rsquo;s Hill, and through an end
of a clachan on the braeside among fields. There was
a whir of looms in it went from house to house; bees
bummed in the gardens; the neighbours that I saw at
the doorsteps talked in a strange tongue; and I found
out later that this was Picardy, a village where the French
weavers wrought for the Linen Company. Here I got
a fresh direction for Pilrig, my destination; and a little
beyond, on the wayside, came by a gibbet and two men
hanged in chains. They were dipped in tar, as the manner
is; the wind span them, the chains clattered, and the birds
hung about the uncanny jumping-jacks and cried. The
sight coming on me suddenly, like an illustration of my
fears, I could scarce be done with examining it and drinking
in discomfort. And as I thus turned and turned about the
gibbet, what should I strike on, but a weird old wife, that
sat behind a leg of it, and nodded, and talked aloud to
herself, with becks and courtesies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are these two, mother?&rdquo; I asked, and pointed
to the corpses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A blessing on your precious face!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Twa
joes<a name="FnAnchor_7" href="#Footnote_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a> o&rsquo; mine: just twa o&rsquo; my old joes, my hinny dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did they suffer for?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ou, just for the guid cause,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Aften I
spaed to them the way that it would end. Twa shillin&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28"></a>28</span>
Scots: no pickle mair; and there are twa bonny callants
hingin&rsquo; for&rsquo;t! They took it frae a wean<a name="FnAnchor_8" href="#Footnote_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a> belanged to
Brouchton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; said I to myself, and not to the daft limmer,
&ldquo;and did they come to such a figure for so poor a business?
This is to lose all indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gie&rsquo;s your loof,<a name="FnAnchor_9" href="#Footnote_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a> hinny,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;and let me spae
your weird to ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, mother,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I see far enough the way I
am. It&rsquo;s an unco thing to see too far in front.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I read it in your bree,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bonny
lassie that has bricht een, and there&rsquo;s a wee man in a braw
coat, and a big man in a pouthered wig, and there&rsquo;s the
shadow of the wuddy,<a name="FnAnchor_10" href="#Footnote_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a> joe, that lies braid across your path.
Gie&rsquo;s your loof, hinny, and let Auld Merren spae it to ye
bonny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two chance shots that seemed to point at Alan
and the daughter of James More, struck me hard; and
I fled from the eldritch creature, casting her a bawbee,
which she continued to sit and play with under the moving
shadows of the hanged.</p>

<p>My way down the causeway of Leith Walk would
have been more pleasant to me but for this encounter.
The old rampart ran among fields, the like of them I had
never seen for artfulness of agriculture; I was pleased,
besides, to be so far in the still countryside; but the shackles
of the gibbet clattered in my head; and the mops and mows
of the old witch, and the thought of the dead men, hag-rode
my spirits. To hang on a gallows, that seemed a hard case;
and whether a man came to hang there for two shillings
Scots, or (as Mr. Stewart had it) from the sense of duty,
once he was tarred and shackled and hung up, the difference
seemed small. There might David Balfour hang, and other
lads pass on their errands and think light of him; and old
daft limmers sit at a leg-foot and spae their fortunes; and
the clean genty maids go by, and look to the other side,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"></a>29</span>
and hold a nose. I saw them plain, and they had grey
eyes, and their screens upon their heads were of the
Drummond colours.</p>

<p>I was thus in the poorest of spirits, though still pretty
resolved, when I came in view of Pilrig, a pleasant gabled
house set by the Walk-side among some brave young woods.
The laird&rsquo;s horse was standing saddled at the door as I came
up, but himself was in the study, where he received me in
the midst of learned works and musical instruments, for
he was not only a deep philosopher but much of a musician.
He greeted me at first pretty well, and, when he had read
Rankeillor&rsquo;s letter, placed himself obligingly at my disposal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is it, cousin David?&rdquo; says he&mdash;&ldquo;since it
appears that we are cousins&mdash;what is this that I can do
for you? A word to Prestongrange? Doubtless that is
easily given. But what should be the word?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Balfour,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if I were to tell you my whole
story the way it fell out, it&rsquo;s my opinion (and it was
Rankeillor&rsquo;s before me) that you would be very little made
up with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to hear this of you, kinsman,&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must not take that at your hands, Mr. Balfour,&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;I have nothing to my charge to make me sorry,
or you for me, but just the common infirmities of mankind.
&lsquo;The guilt of Adam&rsquo;s first sin, the want of original righteousness,
and the corruption of my whole nature,&rsquo; so much I
must answer for, and I hope I have been taught where to
look for help,&rdquo; I said; for I judged from the look of the man
he would think the better of me if I knew my Questions.<a name="FnAnchor_11" href="#Footnote_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a>
&ldquo;But in the way of worldly honour I have no great stumble
to reproach myself with; and my difficulties have befallen
me very much against my will and (by all that I can see)
without my fault. My trouble is, to have become dipped
in a political complication, which it is judged you would
be blithe to avoid a knowledge of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, very well, Mr. David,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>30</span>
pleased to see you are all that Rankeillor represented.
And for what you say of political complications, you do
me no more than justice. It is my study to be beyond
suspicion, and indeed outside the field of it. The question
is,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;how, if I am to know nothing of the matter,
I can very well assist you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I propose you should write to
his lordship, that I am a young man of reasonable good
family and of good means: both of which I believe to be
the case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have Rankeillor&rsquo;s word for it,&rdquo; said Mr. Balfour,
&ldquo;and I count that a warrandice against all deadly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To which you might add (if you will take my word
for so much) that I am a good churchman, loyal to King
George, and so brought up,&rdquo; I went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of which will do you any harm,&rdquo; said Mr.
Balfour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you might go on to say that I sought his lordship
on a matter of great moment, connected with his
Majesty&rsquo;s service and the administration of justice,&rdquo; I
suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I am not to hear the matter,&rdquo; says the laird, &ldquo;I
will not take upon myself to qualify its weight. &lsquo;Great
moment&rsquo; therefore falls, and &lsquo;moment&rsquo; along with it.
For the rest, I might express myself much as you propose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then, sir,&rdquo; said I, and rubbed my neck a little
with my thumb, &ldquo;then I would be very desirous if you
could slip in a word that might perhaps tell for my
protection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Protection?&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;for your protection? Here
is a phrase that somewhat dampens me. If the matter
be so dangerous, I own I would be a little loath to move
in it blindfold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe I could indicate in two words where the
thing sticks,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps that would be the best,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s the Appin murder,&rdquo; said I.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"></a>31</span>
He held up both his hands. &ldquo;Sirs! sirs!&rdquo; cried he.</p>

<p>I thought by the expression of his face and voice that
I had lost my helper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me explain ...&rdquo; I began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you kindly, I will hear no more of it,&rdquo; says
he. &ldquo;I decline <i>in toto</i> to hear more of it. For your name&rsquo;s
sake and Rankeillor&rsquo;s, and perhaps a little for your own,
I will do what I can to help you; but I will hear no more
upon the facts. And it is my first clear duty to warn you.
These are deep waters, Mr. David, and you are a young man.
Be cautious and think twice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is to be supposed I will have thought oftener than
that, Mr. Balfour,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I will direct your attention
again to Rankeillor&rsquo;s letter, where (I hope and believe)
he has registered his approval of that which I design.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said he; and then again, &ldquo;Well, well! I
will do what I can for you.&rdquo; Therewith he took a pen
and paper, sat a while in thought, and began to write
with much consideration. &ldquo;I understand that Rankeillor
approves of what you have in mind?&rdquo; he asked presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After some discussion, sir, he bade me to go forward
in God&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the name to go in,&rdquo; said Mr. Balfour, and
resumed his writing. Presently, he signed, re-read what
he had written, and addressed me again. &ldquo;Now here,
Mr. David,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is a letter of introduction, which
I will seal without closing, and give into your hands open,
as the form requires. But since I am acting in the dark,
I will just read it to you, so that you may see if it will secure
your end:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
<p class="rt">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Pilrig</span>, <i>August 26th</i>, 1751.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">My Lord</span>,&mdash;This is to bring to your notice my namesake and
cousin, David Balfour, Esquire of Shaws, a young gentleman of unblemished
descent and good estate. He has enjoyed besides the
more valuable advantages of a godly training, and his political
principles are all that your lordship can desire. I am not in Mr.
Balfour s confidence, but I understand him to have a matter to declare,
touching his Majesty&rsquo;s service and the administration of justice:
purposes for which your lordship&rsquo;s zeal is known. I should add that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32"></a>32</span>
the young gentleman&rsquo;s intention is known to and approved by some
of his friends, who will watch with hopeful anxiety the event of his
success or failure.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Whereupon,&rdquo; continued Mr. Balfour, &ldquo;I have subscribed
myself with the usual compliments. You observe
I have said &lsquo;some of your friends&rsquo;; I hope you can justify
my plural?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfectly, sir; my purpose is known and approved
by more than one,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;And your letter, which I
take a pleasure to thank you for, is all I could have hoped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was all I could squeeze out,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and from
what I know of the matter you design to meddle in, I can
only pray God that it may prove sufficient.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h5>LORD ADVOCATE PRESTONGRANGE</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">My</span> kinsman kept me to a meal, &ldquo;for the honour of the
roof,&rdquo; he said; and I believe I made the better speed
on my return. I had no thought but to be done with
the next stage, and have myself fully committed; to a
person circumstanced as I was, the appearance of closing
a door on hesitation and temptation was itself extremely
tempting; and I was the more disappointed, when I came
to Prestongrange&rsquo;s house, to be informed he was abroad.
I believe it was true at the moment, and for some hours
after; and then I have no doubt the Advocate came home
again, and enjoyed himself in a neighbouring chamber
among friends, while perhaps the very fact of my arrival
was forgotten. I would have gone away a dozen times,
only for this strong drawing to have done with my
declaration out of hand, and be able to lay me down
to sleep with a free conscience. At first I read, for the
little cabinet where I was left contained a variety of
books. But I fear I read with little profit; and the
weather falling cloudy, the dusk coming up earlier than
usual, and my cabinet being lighted with but a loophole
of a window, I was at last obliged to desist from this
diversion (such as it was), and pass the rest of my time
of waiting in a very burthensome vacuity. The sound of
people talking in a near chamber, the pleasant note of a
harpsichord, and once the voice of a lady singing, bore me
a kind of company.</p>

<p>I do not know the hour, but the darkness was long
come, when the door of the cabinet opened, and I was aware,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34"></a>34</span>
by the light behind him, of a tall figure of a man upon the
threshold. I rose at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is anybody there?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am bearer of a letter from the laird of Pilrig to the
Lord Advocate,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you been here long?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not like to hazard an estimate of how many
hours,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the first I hear of it,&rdquo; he replied, with a chuckle.
&ldquo;The lads must have forgotten you. But you are in the
bit at last, for I am Prestongrange.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he passed before me into the next room,
whither (upon his sign) I followed him, and where he
lit a candle and took his place before a business-table.
It was a long room, of a good proportion, wholly lined
with books. That small spark of light in a corner struck
out the man&rsquo;s handsome person and strong face. He was
flushed, his eye watered and sparkled, and before he sat
down I observed him to sway back and forth. No doubt
he had been supping liberally; but his mind and tongue
were under full control.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, sit ye down,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and let us see
Pilrig&rsquo;s letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He glanced it through in the beginning carelessly, looking
up and bowing when he came to my name; but at the
last words I thought I observed his attention to redouble,
and I made sure he read them twice. All this while you
are to suppose my heart was beating, for I had now crossed
my Rubicon and was come fairly on the field of battle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr. Balfour,&rdquo;
he said, when he had done. &ldquo;Let me offer you a glass of
claret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Under your favour, my lord, I think it would scarce
be fair on me,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I have come here, as the letter
will have mentioned, on a business of some gravity to myself;
and as I am little used with wine, I might be the sooner
affected.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"></a>35</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall be the judge,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But if you will
permit, I believe I will even have the bottle in myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He touched a bell, and a footman came, as at a signal,
bringing wine and glasses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are sure you will not join me?&rdquo; asked the
Advocate. &ldquo;Well, here is to our better acquaintance!&mdash;In
what way can I serve you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should perhaps begin by telling you, my lord, that
I am here at your own pressing invitation,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have the advantage of me somewhere,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;for I profess I think I never heard of you before this
evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right, my lord, the name is indeed new to you,&rdquo;
said I. &ldquo;And yet you have been for some time extremely
wishful to make my acquaintance, and have declared the
same in public.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would afford me a clue,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;I
am no Daniel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will perhaps serve for such,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that if
I was in a jesting humour&mdash;which is far from the case&mdash;I
believe I might lay a claim on your lordship for two hundred
pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In what sense?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the sense of rewards offered for my person,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>He thrust away his glass once and for all, and sat
straight up in the chair where he had been previously
lolling. &ldquo;What am I to understand?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>A tall strong lad of about eighteen</i>,&rsquo;&rdquo; I quoted;
&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>speaks like a Lowlander, and has no beard</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I recognise those words,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;which, if you
have come here with any ill-judged intention of amusing
yourself, are like to prove extremely prejudicial to your
safety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My purpose in this,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;is just entirely as
serious as life and death, and you have understood me
perfectly. I am the boy who was speaking with Glenure
when he was shot.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"></a>36</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I can only suppose (seeing you here) that you claim
to be innocent,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The inference is clear,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I am a very loyal
subject to King George, but if I had anything to reproach
myself with, I would have had more discretion than to
walk into your den.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad of that,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;This horrid crime,
Mr. Balfour, is of a dye which cannot permit any clemency.
Blood has been barbarously shed. It has been shed in
direct opposition to his Majesty and our whole frame of
laws, by those who are their known and public oppugnants.
I take a very high sense of this. I will not deny that I
consider the crime as directly personal to his Majesty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And unfortunately, my lord,&rdquo; I added, a little drily,
&ldquo;directly personal to another great personage who may
be nameless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you mean anything by those words, I must tell
you I consider them unfit for a good subject; and were
they spoke publicly I should make it my business to take
note of them,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You do not appear to me to
recognise the gravity of your situation, or you would be
more careful not to pejorate the same by words which
glance upon the purity of justice. Justice, in this country,
and in my poor hands, is no respecter of persons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You give me too great a share in my own speech,
my lord,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I did but repeat the common talk
of the country, which I have heard everywhere, and from
men of all opinions, as I came along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you are come to more discretion you will understand
such talk is not to be listened to, how much less
repeated,&rdquo; says the Advocate. &ldquo;But I acquit you of an
ill intention. That nobleman, whom we all honour, and
who has indeed been wounded in a near place by the late
barbarity, sits too high to be reached by these aspersions.
The Duke of Argyle&mdash;you see that I deal plainly with you&mdash;takes
it to heart as I do, and as we are both bound to
do by our judicial functions and the service of his Majesty;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"></a>37</span>
and I could wish that all hands, in this ill age, were equally
clean of family rancour. But from the accident that this
is a Campbell who has fallen martyr to his duty&mdash;as who
else but the Campbells have ever put themselves foremost
on that path?&mdash;I may say it, who am no Campbell&mdash;and
that the chief of that great house happens (for
all our advantages) to be the present head of the College
of Justice, small minds and disaffected tongues are set
agog in every change-house in the country; and I find a
young gentleman like Mr. Balfour so ill-advised as to make
himself their echo.&rdquo; So much he spoke with a very
oratorical delivery, as if in Court, and then declined again
upon the manner of a gentleman. &ldquo;All this apart,&rdquo; said
he. &ldquo;It now remains that I should learn what I am to
do with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had thought it was rather I that should learn the
same from your lordship,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, true,&rdquo; says the Advocate. &ldquo;But, you see,
you come to me well recommended. There is a good
honest Whig name to this letter,&rdquo; says he, picking it up
a moment from the table. &ldquo;And&mdash;extra-judicially, Mr.
Balfour&mdash;there is always the possibility of some arrangement.
I tell you, and I tell you beforehand that you may be the
more upon your guard, your fate lies with me singly. In such
a matter (be it said with reverence) I am more powerful than
the King&rsquo;s Majesty; and should you please me&mdash;and of course
satisfy my conscience&mdash;in what remains to be held of our
interview, I tell you it may remain between ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meaning how?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I mean it thus, Mr. Balfour,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that
if you give satisfaction, no soul need know so much as
that you visited my house; and you may observe that
I do not even call my clerk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I saw what way he was driving. &ldquo;I suppose it is
needless any one should be informed upon my visit,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;though the precise nature of my gains by that I cannot
see. I am not at all ashamed of coming here.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"></a>38</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And have no cause to be,&rdquo; says he encouragingly.
&ldquo;Nor yet (if you are careful) to fear the consequences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;speaking under your correction,
I am not very easy to be frightened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I am sure I do not seek to frighten you,&rdquo; says
he. &ldquo;But to the interrogation; and let me warn you to
volunteer nothing beyond the questions I shall ask you.
It may consist very immediately with your safety. I
have a great discretion, it is true, but there are bounds
to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall try to follow your lordship&rsquo;s advice,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>He spread a sheet of paper on the table and wrote a
heading. &ldquo;It appears you were present, by the way,
in the wood of Lettermore at the moment of the fatal
shot,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;Was this by accident?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By accident,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How came you in speech with Colin Campbell?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was inquiring my way of him to Aucharn,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>I observed he did not write this answer down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m, true,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I had forgotten that. And
do you know, Mr. Balfour, I would dwell, if I were you,
as little as might be on your relations with these Stewarts.
It might be found to complicate our business. I am not
yet inclined to regard these matters as essential.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had thought, my lord, that all points of fact were
equally material in such a case,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You forget we are now trying these Stewarts,&rdquo; he
replied, with great significance. &ldquo;If we should ever come
to be trying you, it will be very different; and I shall
press these very questions that I am now willing to glide
upon. But to resume: I have it here in Mr. Mungo Campbell&rsquo;s
precognition that you ran immediately up the brae.
How came that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not immediately, my lord, and the cause was my
seeing of the murderer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You saw him, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"></a>39</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;As plain as I see your lordship, though not so near
hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should know him again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In your pursuit you were not so fortunate, then, as
to overtake him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was he alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was no one else in that neighbourhood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alan Breck Stewart was not far off, in a piece of a
wood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Advocate laid his pen down. &ldquo;I think we are
playing at cross-purposes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;which you will find
to prove a very ill amusement for yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I content myself with following your lordship&rsquo;s advice,
and answering what I am asked,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be so wise as to bethink yourself in time,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;I use you with the most anxious tenderness, which you
scarce seem to appreciate, and which (unless you be more
careful) may prove to be in vain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do appreciate your tenderness, but conceive it to
be mistaken,&rdquo; I replied, with something of a falter, for
I saw we were come to grips at last. &ldquo;I am here to lay
before you certain information, by which I shall convince
you Alan had no hand whatever in the killing of Glenure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Advocate appeared for a moment at a stick, sitting
with pursed lips, and blinking his eyes upon me like an
angry cat. &ldquo;Mr. Balfour,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;I tell you
pointedly you go an ill way for your own interests.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I am as free of the charge of considering
my own interests in this matter as your lordship.
As God judges me, I have but the one design, and that is
to see justice executed and the innocent go clear. If in
pursuit of that I come to fall under your lordship&rsquo;s displeasure,
I must bear it as I may.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this he rose from his chair, lit a second candle, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"></a>40</span>
for a while gazed upon me steadily. I was surprised to see
a great change of gravity fallen upon his face, and I could
have almost thought he was a little pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are either very simple, or extremely the reverse,
and I see that I must deal with you more confidentially,&rdquo;
says he. &ldquo;This is a political case&mdash;ah, yes, Mr. Balfour!
whether we like it or no, the case is political&mdash;and I tremble
when I think what issues may depend from it. To a
political case, I need scarce tell a young man of your education,
we approach with very different thoughts from one
which is criminal only. <i>Salus populi suprema lex</i> is a
maxim susceptible of great abuse, but it has that force
which we find elsewhere only in the laws of nature: I mean
it has the force of necessity. I will open this out to you,
if you will allow me, at more length. You would have me
believe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Under your pardon, my lord, I would have you to
believe nothing but that which I can prove,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tut! tut! young gentleman,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;be not so
pragmatical, and suffer a man who might be your father
(if it was nothing more) to employ his own imperfect
language, and express his own poor thoughts, even when
they have the misfortune not to coincide with Mr. Balfour&rsquo;s.
You would have me to believe Breck innocent. I would
think this of little account, the more so as we cannot catch
our man. But the matter of Breck&rsquo;s innocence shoots
beyond itself. Once admitted, it would destroy the whole
presumptions of our case against another and a very different
criminal; a man grown old in treason, already twice
in arms against his king, and already twice forgiven; a
fomenter of discontent, and (whoever may have fired the
shot) the unmistakable original of the deed in question. I
need not tell you that I mean James Stewart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I can just say plainly that the innocence of Alan
and of James is what I am here to declare in private to
your lordship, and what I am prepared to establish at the
trial by my testimony,&rdquo; said I.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41"></a>41</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;To which I can only answer by an equal plainness, Mr.
Balfour,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that (in that case) your testimony will
not be called by me, and I desire you to withhold it
altogether.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are at the head of Justice in this country,&rdquo; I cried,
&ldquo;and you propose to me a crime!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a man nursing with both hands the interests of
this country,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and I press on you a political
necessity. Patriotism is not always moral in the formal
sense. You might be glad of it, I think: it is your own
protection; the facts are heavy against you; and if I am
still trying to except you from a very dangerous place, it is
in part of course because I am not insensible to your honesty
in coming here; in part because of Pilrig&rsquo;s letter; but in
part, and in chief part, because I regard in this matter my
political duty first and my judicial duty only second. For
the same reason&mdash;I repeat it to you in the same frank words&mdash;I
do not want your testimony.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I desire not to be thought to make a repartee, when I
express only the plain sense of our position,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;But
if your lordship has no need of my testimony, I believe the
other side would be extremely blithe to get it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prestongrange arose and began to pace to and fro in the
room. &ldquo;You are not so young,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but what you
must remember very clearly the year &rsquo;Forty-five and the
shock that went about the country. I read in Pilrig&rsquo;s letter
that you are sound in Kirk and State. Who saved them in
that fatal year? I do not refer to his Royal Highness and
his ramrods, which were extremely useful in their day; but
the country had been saved and the field won before ever
Cumberland came upon Drummossie. Who saved it? I
repeat; who saved the Protestant religion and the whole
frame of our civil institutions? The late Lord President
Culloden, for one; he played a man&rsquo;s part, and small thanks
he got for it&mdash;even as I, whom you see before you, straining
every nerve in the same service, look for no reward beyond
the conscience of my duties done. After the President,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42"></a>42</span>
who else? You know the answer as well as I do; &rsquo;tis partly
a scandal, and you glanced at it yourself, and I reproved
you for it, when you first came in. It was the Duke and
the great clan of Campbell. Now here is a Campbell foully
murdered, and that in the King&rsquo;s service. The Duke and
I are Highlanders. But we are Highlanders civilised, and
it is not so with the great mass of our clans and families.
They have still savage virtues and defects. They are still
barbarians, like these Stewarts; only the Campbells were barbarians
on the right side, and the Stewarts were barbarians
on the wrong. Now be you the judge. The Campbells
expect vengeance. If they do not get it&mdash;if this man James
escape&mdash;there will be trouble with the Campbells. That
means disturbance in the Highlands, which are uneasy and
very far from being disarmed: the disarming is a farce....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can bear you out in that,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Disturbance in the Highlands makes the hour of our
old watchful enemy,&rdquo; pursued his lordship, holding out a
finger as he paced; &ldquo;and I give you my word we may have
a &rsquo;Forty-five again with the Campbells on the other side.
To protect the life of this man Stewart&mdash;which is forfeit
already on half a dozen different counts if not on this&mdash;do
you propose to plunge your country in war, to jeopardise
the faith of your fathers, and to expose the lives and fortunes
of how many thousand innocent persons?... These are
considerations that weigh with me, and that I hope will
weigh no less with yourself, Mr. Balfour, as a lover of your
country, good government, and religious truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You deal with me very frankly, and I thank you for
it,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I will try on my side to be no less honest. I
believe your policy to be sound. I believe these deep duties
may lie upon your lordship; I believe you may have laid
them on your conscience when you took the oaths of the
high office which you hold. But for me, who am just a
plain man&mdash;or scarce a man yet&mdash;the plain duties must
suffice. I can think but of two things: of a poor soul in the
immediate and unjust danger of a shameful death, and of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"></a>43</span>
cries and tears of his wife, that still tingle in my head. I cannot
see beyond, my lord. It&rsquo;s the way that I am made. If the
country has to fall, it has to fall. And I pray God, if this be
wilful blindness, that He may enlighten me before too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had heard me motionless, and stood so a while longer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is an unexpected obstacle,&rdquo; says he, aloud, but
to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how is your lordship to dispose of me?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I wished,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you know that you might sleep
in gaol.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have slept in worse places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my boy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there is one thing appears
very plainly from our interview, that I may rely on your
pledged word. Give me your honour that you will be
wholly secret, not only on what has passed to-night, but
in the matter of the Appin case, and I let you go free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will give it till to-morrow or any other near day
that you may please to set,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I would not be
thought too wily; but if I gave the promise without qualification
your lordship would have attained his end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had no thought to entrap you,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure of that,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;To-morrow is the
Sabbath. Come to me on Monday by eight in the morning,
and give me your promise until then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Freely given, my lord,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;And with regard
to what has fallen from yourself, I will give it for as long as
it shall please God to spare your days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will observe,&rdquo; he said next, &ldquo;that I have made no
employment of menaces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was like your lordship&rsquo;s nobility,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Yet I
am not altogether so dull but what I can perceive the nature
of those you have not uttered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;good-night to you. May you sleep
well, for I think it is more than I am like to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that he sighed, took up a candle, and gave me his
conveyance as far as the street-door.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<h5>IN THE ADVOCATE&rsquo;S HOUSE</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> next day, Sabbath, August 27th, I had the occasion I
had long looked forward to, to hear some of the famous
Edinburgh preachers, all well known to me already by the
report of Mr. Campbell. Alas! and I might just as well
have been at Essendean, and sitting under Mr. Campbell&rsquo;s
worthy self! the turmoil of my thoughts, which dwelt continually
on the interview with Prestongrange, inhibiting me
from all attention. I was indeed much less impressed by the
reasoning of the divines than by the spectacle of the thronged
congregation in the churches, like what I imagined of a theatre
or (in my then disposition) of an assize of trial; above all at
the West Kirk, with its three tiers of galleries, where I went
in the vain hope that I might see Miss Drummond.</p>

<p>On the Monday I betook me for the first time to a barber&rsquo;s,
and was very well pleased with the result. Thence to
the Advocate&rsquo;s, where the red coats of the soldiers showed
again about his door, making a bright place in the close. I
looked about for the young lady and her gillies: there was
never a sign of them. But I was no sooner shown into the
cabinet or antechamber where I had spent so weariful a
time upon the Saturday, than I was aware of the tall figure
of James More in a corner. He seemed a prey to a painful
uneasiness, reaching forth his feet and hands, and his eyes
speeding here and there without rest about the walls of the
small chamber, which recalled to me with a sense of pity
the man&rsquo;s wretched situation. I suppose it was partly this,
and partly my strong continuing interest in his daughter,
that moved me to accost him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"></a>45</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Give you a good-morning, sir,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a good-morning to you, sir,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bide tryst with Prestongrange?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, sir, and I pray your business with that gentleman
be more agreeable than mine,&rdquo; was his reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope at least that yours will be brief, for I suppose
you pass before me,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All pass before me,&rdquo; he said, with a shrug and a gesture
upward of the open hands. &ldquo;It was not always so, sir, but
times change. It was not so when the sword was in the scale,
young gentleman, and the virtues of the soldier might sustain
themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There came a kind of Highland snuffle out of the man
that raised my dander strangely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Macgregor,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I understand the main
thing for a soldier is to be silent, and the first of his virtues
never to complain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have my name, I perceive&rdquo;&mdash;he bowed to me
with his arms crossed&mdash;&ldquo;though it&rsquo;s one I must not use
myself. Well, there is a publicity&mdash;I have shown my face
and told my name too often in the beards of my enemies. I
must not wonder if both should be known to many that
I know not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you know not in the least, sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;nor yet
anybody else; but the name I am called, if you care to hear
it, is Balfour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a good name,&rdquo; he replied civilly; &ldquo;there are
many decent folk that use it. And now that I call to mind,
there was a young gentleman, your namesake, that marched
surgeon in the year &rsquo;Forty-five with my battalion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe that would be a brother to Balfour of Baith,&rdquo;
said I, for I was ready for the surgeon now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The same, sir,&rdquo; said James More. &ldquo;And since I have
been fellow-soldier with your kinsman, you must suffer me
to grasp your hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook hands with me long and tenderly, beaming on
me the while as though he had found a brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page46"></a>46</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;these are changed days since your
cousin and I heard the balls whistle in our lugs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he was a very far-away cousin,&rdquo; said I drily,
&ldquo;and I ought to tell you that I never clapped eyes upon the
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it makes no change. And you&mdash;I
do not think you were out yourself, sir&mdash;I have no
clear mind of your face, which is one not probable to be
forgotten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the year you refer to, Mr. Macgregor, I was getting
skelped in the parish school,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So young!&rdquo; cries he. &ldquo;Ah, then, you will never be
able to think what this meeting is to me. In the hour of
my adversity, and here in the house of my enemy, to meet
in with the blood of an old brother-in-arms&mdash;it heartens me,
Mr. Balfour, like the skirling of the Highland pipes! Sir,
this is a sad look-back that many of us have to make: some
with falling tears. I have lived in my own country like a
king; my sword, my mountains, and the faith of my friends
and kinsmen sufficed for me. Now I lie in a stinking
dungeon; and do you know, Mr. Balfour,&rdquo; he went on,
taking my arm and beginning to lead me about, &ldquo;do you
know, sir, that I lack mere necessaries? The malice of my
foes has quite sequestered my resources. I lie, as you know,
sir, on a trumped-up charge, of which I am as innocent as
yourself. They dare not bring me to my trial, and in the
meanwhile I am held naked in my prison. I could have
wished it was your cousin I had met, or his brother Baith
himself. Either would, I know, have been rejoiced to
help me; while a comparative stranger like yourself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I would be ashamed to set down all he poured out to
me in this beggarly vein, or the very short and grudging
answers that I made to him. There were times when I
was tempted to stop his mouth with some small change;
but whether it was from shame or pride&mdash;whether it was
for my own sake or Catriona&rsquo;s&mdash;whether it was because
I thought him no fit father for his daughter, or because I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47"></a>47</span>
resented that grossness of immediate falsity that clung about
the man himself&mdash;the thing was clean beyond me. And I
was still being wheedled and preached to, and still being
marched to and fro, three steps and a turn, in that small
chamber, and had already, by some very short replies,
highly incensed, although not finally discouraged, my
beggar, when Prestongrange appeared in the doorway and
bade me eagerly into his big chamber.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a moment&rsquo;s engagement,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and that
you may not sit empty-handed I am going to present you to
my three braw daughters, of whom perhaps you may have
heard, for I think they are more famous than papa.&mdash;This
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He led me into another long room above, where a dry
old lady sat at a frame of embroidery, and the three handsomest
young women (I suppose) in Scotland stood together
by a window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is my new friend, Mr. Balfour,&rdquo; said he, presenting
me by the arm.&mdash;&ldquo;David, here is my sister, Miss Grant,
who is so good as keep my house for me, and will be very
pleased if she can help you. And here,&rdquo; says he, turning
to the three younger ladies, &ldquo;here are my <i>three braw
dauchters</i>. A fair question to ye, Mr. Davie: which of the
three is the best favoured? And I wager he will never
have the impudence to propound honest Allan Ramsay&rsquo;s
answer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hereupon all three, and the old Miss Grant as well,
cried out against this sally, which (as I was acquainted
with the verses he referred to) brought shame into my own
cheek. It seemed to me a citation unpardonable in a father,
and I was amazed that these ladies could laugh even while
they reproved, or made believe to.</p>

<p>Under cover of this mirth, Prestongrange got forth of
the chamber, and I was left, like a fish upon dry land, in
that very unsuitable society. I could never deny, in looking
back upon what followed, that I was eminently stockish;
and I must say the ladies were well drilled to have so long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"></a>48</span>
a patience with me. The aunt indeed sat close at her
embroidery, only looking now and again and smiling; but
the misses, and especially the eldest, who was besides the
most handsome, paid me a score of attentions which I was
very ill able to repay. It was all in vain to tell myself I
was a young fellow of some worth as well as a good estate,
and had no call to feel abashed before these lasses, the
eldest not so much older than myself, and no one of them
by any probability half as learned. Reasoning would not
change the fact; and there were times when the colour
came into my face to think I was shaved that day for the
first time.</p>

<p>The talk going, with all their endeavours, very heavily,
the eldest took pity on my awkwardness, sat down to her
instrument, of which she was a past mistress, and entertained
me for a while with playing and singing, both in the
Scots and in the Italian manners; this put me more at my
ease, and being reminded of Alan&rsquo;s air that he had taught
me in the hole near Carriden, I made so bold as to whistle
a bar or two, and ask if she knew that.</p>

<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;I never heard a note of it,&rdquo;
said she. &ldquo;Whistle it all through. And now once again,&rdquo;
she added, after I had done so.</p>

<p>Then she picked it out upon the keyboard, and (to
my surprise) instantly enriched the same with well-sounding
chords, and sang, as she played, with a very droll
expression and broad accent&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;Haena I got just the lilt of it?</p>
<p class="i05">Isna this the tune that ye whustled?</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;I can do the poetry too, only
it won&rsquo;t rhyme. And then again:</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;I am Miss Grant, sib to the Advocate:</p>
<p class="i05">You, I believe, are Dauvit Balfour.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>I told her how much astonished I was by her genius.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what do you call the name of it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49"></a>49</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know the real name,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I just call
it &lsquo;Alan&rsquo;s air.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at me directly in the face. &ldquo;I shall call
it &lsquo;David&rsquo;s air,&rsquo;&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;though if it&rsquo;s the least like
what your namesake of Israel played to Saul I would never
wonder that the king got little good by it, for it&rsquo;s but
melancholy music. Your other name I do not like; so if
you was ever wishing to hear your tune again you are to
ask for it by mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was said with a significance that gave my heart
a jog. &ldquo;Why that, Miss Grant?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;if ever you should come to get
hanged, I will set your last dying speech and confession
to that tune and sing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This put it beyond a doubt that she was partly informed
of my story and peril. How, or just how much,
it was more difficult to guess. It was plain she knew there
was something of danger in the name of Alan, and thus
warned me to leave it out of reference; and plain she knew
that I stood under some criminal suspicion. I judged
besides that the harshness of her last speech (which besides
she had followed up immediately with a very noisy piece
of music) was to put an end to the present conversation.
I stood beside her, affecting to listen and admire, but truly
whirled away by my own thoughts. I have always found
this young lady to be a lover of the mysterious; and
certainly this first interview made a mystery that was
beyond my plummet. One thing I learned long after: the
hours of Sunday had been well employed, the bank-porter
had been found and examined, my visit to Charles Stewart
was discovered, and the deduction made that I was pretty
deep with James and Alan, and most likely in a continued
correspondence with the last. Hence this broad hint that
was given me across the harpsichord.</p>

<p>In the midst of the piece of music one of the younger
misses, who was at a window over the close, cried on her
sisters to come quick, for there was &ldquo;<i>Grey eyes</i> again.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>50</span>
The whole family trooped there at once, and crowded one
another for a look. The window whither they ran was in
an odd corner of that room, gave above the entrance-door,
and flanked up the close.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Mr. Balfour,&rdquo; they cried, &ldquo;come and see.
She is the most beautiful creature! She hangs round the
close-head these last days, always with some wretched-like
gillies, and yet seems quite a lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had no need to look; neither did I look twice, or
long. I was afraid she might have seen me there, looking
down upon her from that chamber of music, and she without,
and her father in the same house, perhaps begging
for his life with tears, and myself come but newly from
rejecting his petitions. But even that glance set me in a
better conceit of myself, and much less awe of the young
ladies. They were beautiful, that was beyond question,
but Catriona was beautiful too, and had a kind of brightness
in her like a coal of fire. As much as the others cast me
down, she lifted me up. I remembered I had talked easily
with her. If I could make no hand of it with these fine
maids, it was perhaps something their own fault. My
embarrassment began to be a little mingled and lightened
with a sense of fun; and when the aunt smiled at me from
her embroidery, and the three daughters unbent to me like a
baby, all with &ldquo;papa&rsquo;s orders&rdquo; written on their faces, there
were times when I could have found it in my heart to smile
myself.</p>

<p>Presently papa returned, the same kind, happy-like,
pleasant-spoken man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, girls,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I must take Mr. Balfour away
again; but I hope you have been able to persuade him to
return where I shall be always gratified to find him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they each made me a little farthing compliment,
and I was led away.</p>

<p>If this visit to the family had been meant to soften
my resistance, it was the worst of failures. I was no such
ass but what I understood how poor a figure I had made,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>51</span>
and that the girls would be yawning their jaws off as soon
as my stiff back was turned. I felt I had shown how little
I had in me of what was soft and graceful; and I longed
for a chance to prove that I had something of the other
stuff, the stern and dangerous.</p>

<p>Well, I was to be served to my desire, for the scene to
which he was conducting me was of a different character.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<h5>UMQUHILE THE MASTER OF LOVAT</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">There</span> was a man waiting us in Prestongrange&rsquo;s study,
whom I distasted at the first look, as we distaste a ferret
or an earwig. He was bitter ugly, but seemed very much
of a gentleman; had still manners, but capable of sudden
leaps and violences; and a small voice, which could ring
out shrill and dangerous when he so desired.</p>

<p>The Advocate presented us in a familiar, friendly way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, Fraser,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;here is Mr. Balfour whom
we talked about.&mdash;Mr. David, this is Mr. Simon Fraser,
whom we used to call by another title, but that is an old
song. Mr. Fraser has an errand to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that he stepped aside to his book-shelves, and
made believe to consult a quarto volume in the far
end.</p>

<p>I was thus left (in a sense) alone with perhaps the last
person in the world I had expected. There was no doubt
upon the terms of introduction; this could be no other
than the forfeited Master of Lovat and chief of the great
clan Fraser. I knew he had led his men in the Rebellion;
I knew his father&rsquo;s head&mdash;my old lord&rsquo;s, that grey fox
of the mountains&mdash;to have fallen on the block for that
offence, the lands of the family to have been seized, and
their nobility attainted. I could not conceive what he
should be doing in Grant&rsquo;s house; I could not conceive
that he had been called to the Bar, had eaten all his principles,
and was now currying favour with the Government,
even to the extent of acting Advocate-Depute in the Appin
murder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"></a>53</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Balfour,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what is all this I hear
of ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would not become me to prejudge,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but
if the Advocate was your authority he is fully possessed
of my opinions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may tell you I am engaged in the Appin case,&rdquo;
he went on; &ldquo;I am to appear under Prestongrange; and
from my study of the precognitions I can assure you your
opinions are erroneous. The guilt of Breck is manifest;
and your testimony, in which you admit you saw him on
the hill at the very moment, will certify his hanging.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be rather ill to hang him till you catch him,&rdquo;
I observed. &ldquo;And for other matters, I very willingly
leave you to your own impressions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Duke has been informed,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I
have just come from his Grace, and he expressed himself
before me with an honest freedom, like the great nobleman
he is. He spoke of you by name, Mr. Balfour, and
declared his gratitude beforehand in case you would be led
by those who understand your own interests and those
of the country so much better than yourself. Gratitude
is no empty expression in that mouth: <i>experto crede</i>.
I daresay you know something of my name and clan,
and the damnable example and lamented end of my late
father, to say nothing of my own errata. Well, I have
made my peace with that good Duke; he has intervened
for me with our friend Prestongrange; and here I am with
my foot in the stirrup again and some of the responsibility
shared into my hand of prosecuting King George&rsquo;s enemies
and avenging the late daring and barefaced insult to his
Majesty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doubtless a proud position for your father&rsquo;s son,&rdquo;
says I.</p>

<p>He wagged his bald eyebrows at me. &ldquo;You are pleased
to make experiments in the ironical, I think,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;But I am here upon duty; I am here to discharge my
errand in good faith; it is in vain you think to divert me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54"></a>54</span>
And let me tell you, for a young fellow of spirit and ambition
like yourself, a good shove in the beginning will do more
than ten years&rsquo; drudgery. The shove is now at your
command; choose what you will to be advanced in, the
Duke will watch upon you with the affectionate disposition
of a father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am thinking that I lack the docility of the son,&rdquo; says I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do you really suppose, sir, that the whole policy
of this country is to be suffered to trip up and tumble
down for an ill-mannered colt of a boy?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;This
has been made a test case, all who would prosper in the
future must put a shoulder to the wheel. Look at me!
Do you suppose it is for my pleasure that I put myself
in the highly invidious position of prosecuting a man that
I have drawn the sword alongside of? The choice is not
left me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I think, sir, that you forfeited your choice when
you mixed in with that unnatural rebellion,&rdquo; I remarked.
&ldquo;My case is happily otherwise: I am a true man, and
can look either the Duke or King George in the face without
concern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it so the wind sits?&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;I protest you
are fallen in the worst sort of error. Prestongrange has
been hitherto so civil (he tells me) as not to combat your
allegations; but you must not think they are not looked
upon with strong suspicion. You say you are innocent.
My dear sir, the facts declare you guilty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was waiting for you there,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The evidence of Mungo Campbell; your flight after
the completion of the murder; your long course of secrecy&mdash;my
good young man!&rdquo; said Mr. Simon, &ldquo;here is enough
evidence to hang a bullock, let be a David Balfour! I shall
be upon that trial; my voice shall be raised; I shall then
speak much otherwise from what I do to-day, and far less
to your gratification, little as you like it now! Ah, you look
white!&rdquo; cries he. &ldquo;I have found the key of your impudent
heart. You look pale, your eyes waver, Mr. David! You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55"></a>55</span>
see the grave and the gallows nearer by than you had
fancied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I own to a natural weakness,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I think
no shame for that. Shame ...&rdquo; I was going on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shame waits for you on the gibbet,&rdquo; he broke in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where I shall but be even&rsquo;d with my lord your father&rdquo;
said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aha, but not so!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and you do not yet
see to the bottom of this business. My father suffered
in a great cause, and for dealing in the affairs of kings.
You are to hang for a dirty murder about boddle-pieces.
Your personal part in it, the treacherous one of holding
the poor wretch in talk, your accomplices a pack of ragged
Highland gillies. And it can be shown, my great Mr.
Balfour&mdash;it can be shown, and it <i>will</i> be shown, trust <i>me</i>
that has a finger in the pie&mdash;it can be shown, and shall be
shown, that you were paid to do it. I think I can see the
looks go round the Court when I adduce my evidence, and
it shall appear that you, a young man of education, let
yourself be corrupted to this shocking act for a suit of cast
clothes, a bottle of Highland spirits, and three-and-fivepence-halfpenny
in copper money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a touch of the truth in these words that
knocked me like a blow: clothes, a bottle of <i>usquebaugh</i>,
and three-and-fivepence-halfpenny in change, made up,
indeed, the most of what Alan and I had carried from
Aucharn; and I saw that some of James&rsquo;s people had been
blabbing in their dungeons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see I know more than you fancied,&rdquo; he resumed
in triumph. &ldquo;And as for giving it this turn, great Mr.
David, you must not suppose the Government of Great
Britain and Ireland will ever be stuck for want of evidence.
We have men here in prison who will swear out
their lives as we direct them; as I direct, if you prefer
the phrase. So now you are to guess your part of glory
if you choose to die. On the one hand, life, wine, women,
and a duke to be your hand-gun: on the other, a rope to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"></a>56</span>
your craig, and a gibbet to clatter your bones on, and the
lousiest, lowest story to hand down to your namesakes in
the future that was ever told about a hired assassin. And
see here!&rdquo; he cried, with a formidable shrill voice, &ldquo;see
this paper that I pull out of my pocket. Look at the name
there: it is the name of the great David, I believe, the ink
scarce dry yet. Can you guess its nature? It is the warrant
for your arrest, which I have but to touch this bell beside me
to have executed on the spot. Once in the Tolbooth upon
this paper, may God help you, for the die is cast!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I must never deny that I was greatly horrified by so
much baseness, and much unmanned by the immediacy
and ugliness of my danger. Mr. Simon had already gloried
in the changes of my hue; I make no doubt I was now
no ruddier than my shirt; my speech besides trembled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a gentleman in this room,&rdquo; cried I. &ldquo;I
appeal to him. I put my life and credit in his hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prestongrange shut his book with a snap. &ldquo;I told
you so, Simon,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you have played your hand
for all it was worth, and you have lost.&mdash;Mr. David,&rdquo; he
went on, &ldquo;I wish you to believe it was by no choice of
mine you were subjected to this proof. I wish you could
understand how glad I am you should come forth from it
with so much credit. You may not quite see how, but it
is a little of a service to myself. For had our friend here
been more successful than I was last night, it might have
appeared that he was a better judge of men than I; it might
have appeared we were altogether in the wrong situations,
Mr. Simon and myself. And I know our friend Simon to be
ambitious,&rdquo; says he, striking lightly on Fraser&rsquo;s shoulder.
&ldquo;As for this stage-play, it is over; my sentiments are very
much engaged in your behalf; and whatever issue we
can find to this unfortunate affair, I shall make it my
business to see it is adopted with tenderness to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These were very good words, and I could see besides
that there was little love, and perhaps a spice of genuine
ill-will, between those two who were opposed to me. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"></a>57</span>
all that, it was unmistakable this interview had been
designed, perhaps rehearsed, with the consent of both;
it was plain my adversaries were in earnest to try me by
all methods; and now (persuasion, flattery, and menaces
having been tried in vain) I could not but wonder what
would be their next expedient. My eyes besides were still
troubled, and my knees loose under me, with the distress
of the late ordeal; and I could do no more than stammer
the same form of words: &ldquo;I put my life and credit in your
hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;we must try to save them.
And in the meanwhile let us return to gentler methods.
You must not bear any grudge upon my friend Mr. Simon,
who did but speak by his brief. And even if you did conceive
some malice against myself, who stood by and seemed
rather to hold a candle, I must not let that extend to
innocent members of my family. These are greatly engaged
to see more of you, and I cannot consent to have my young
women-folk disappointed. To-morrow they will be going
to Hope Park, where I think it very proper you should
make your bow. Call for me first, when I may possibly
have something for your private hearing; then you shall
be turned abroad again under the conduct of my misses;
and until that time repeat to me your promise of secrecy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had done better to have instantly refused, but in
truth I was beside the power of reasoning; did as I was
bid; took my leave I know not how; and when I was
forth again in the close, and the door had shut behind me,
was glad to lean on a house-wall and wipe my face. That
horrid apparition (as I may call it) of Mr. Simon rang in
my memory, as a sudden noise rings after it is over in the
ear. Tales of the man&rsquo;s father, of his falseness, of his
manifold perpetual treacheries, rose before me from all
that I had heard and read, and joined on with what I had
just experienced of himself. Each time it occurred to me,
the ingenious foulness of that calumny he had proposed to
nail upon my character startled me afresh. The case of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58"></a>58</span>
the man upon the gibbet by Leith Walk appeared scarce
distinguishable from that I was now to consider as my own.
To rob a child of so little more than nothing was certainly
a paltry enterprise for two grown men; but my own tale, as
it was to be represented in a court by Simon Fraser, appeared
a fair second in every possible point of view of sordidness
and cowardice.</p>

<p>The voices of two of Prestongrange&rsquo;s liveried men upon
his doorstep recalled me to myself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hae,&rdquo; said the one; &ldquo;this billet as fast as ye can
link to the captain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that for the cateran back again?&rdquo; asked the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would seem sae,&rdquo; returned the first. &ldquo;Him and
Simon are seeking him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Prestongrange is gane gyte,&rdquo; says the second.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have James More in bed with him next.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel, it&rsquo;s neither your affair nor mine&rsquo;s,&rdquo; says the first.</p>

<p>And they parted, the one upon his errand, and the
other back into the house.</p>

<p>This looked as ill as possible. I was scarce gone and
they were sending already for James More, to whom I
thought Mr. Simon must have pointed when he spoke of
men in prison and ready to redeem their lives by all extremities.
My scalp curdled among my hair, and the next
moment the blood leaped in me to remember Catriona.
Poor lass! her father stood to be hanged for pretty indefensible
misconduct. What was yet more unpalatable,
it now seemed he was prepared to save his four quarters by
the worst of shame and the most foul of cowardly murders&mdash;murder
by the false oath; and, to complete our misfortunes,
it seemed myself was picked out to be the victim.</p>

<p>I began to walk swiftly and at random, conscious only
of a desire for movement, air, and the open country.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page59"></a>59</span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<h5>I MAKE A FAULT IN HONOUR</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">I came</span> forth, I vow I know not how, on the <i>Lang Dykes</i>.<a name="FnAnchor_12" href="#Footnote_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a>
This is a rural road which runs on the north side over-against
the city. Thence I could see the whole black length
of it tail down, from where the castle stands upon its crags
above the loch, in a long line of spires and gable-ends and
smoking chimneys, and at the sight my heart swelled in
my bosom. My youth, as I have told, was already inured
to dangers; but such danger as I had seen the face of but
that morning, in the midst of what they call the safety of
a town, shook me beyond experience. Peril of slavery,
peril of shipwreck, peril of sword and shot, I had stood all
of these without discredit; but the peril there was in the
sharp voice and the fat face of Simon, properly Lord Lovat,
daunted me wholly.</p>

<p>I sat by the lake-side in a place where the rushes went
down into the water, and there steeped my wrists and laved
my temples. If I could have done so with any remains of
self-esteem, I would now have fled from my foolhardy
enterprise. But (call it courage or cowardice, and I believe
it was both the one and the other) I decided I was ventured
out beyond the possibility of a retreat. I had outfaced
these men, I would continue to outface them; come what
might, I would stand by the word spoken.</p>

<p>The sense of my own constancy somewhat uplifted
my spirits, but not much. At the best of it there was an
icy place about my heart, and life seemed a black business
to be at all engaged in. For two souls in particular my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"></a>60</span>
pity flowed. The one was myself, to be so friendless and
lost among dangers. The other was the girl, the daughter
of James More. I had seen but little of her; yet my view
was taken and my judgment made. I thought her a lass
of a clean honour, like a man&rsquo;s; I thought her one to die
of a disgrace; and now I believed her father to be at that
moment bargaining his vile life for mine. It made a bond
in my thoughts betwixt the girl and me. I had seen her
before only as a wayside appearance, though one that
pleased me strangely; I saw her now in a sudden nearness
of relation, as the daughter of my blood-foe, and, I might
say, my murderer. I reflected it was hard I should be so
plagued and persecuted all my days for other folk&rsquo;s affairs,
and have no manner of pleasure myself. I got meals and
a bed to sleep in when my concerns would suffer it; beyond
that my wealth was of no help to me. If I was to hang,
my days were like to be short; if I was not to hang, but
to escape out of this trouble, they might yet seem long
to me ere I was done with them. Of a sudden her face
appeared in my memory, the way I had first seen it, with
the parted lips; at that, weakness came in my bosom
and strength into my legs; and I set resolutely forward
on the way to Dean. If I was to hang to-morrow, and
it was sure enough I might very likely sleep that night
in a dungeon, I determined I should hear and speak once
more with Catriona.</p>

<p>The exercise of walking and the thought of my destination
braced me yet more, so that I began to pluck up a kind of
spirit. In the village of Dean, where it sits in the bottom of
a glen beside the river, I inquired my way of a miller&rsquo;s man,
who sent me up the hill upon the farther side by a plain path,
and so to a decent-like small house in a garden of lawns and
apple-trees. My heart beat high as I stepped inside the
garden hedge, but it fell low indeed when I came face to
face with a grim and fierce old lady, walking there in a white
mutch with a man&rsquo;s hat strapped upon the top of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do ye come seeking here?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page61"></a>61</span></p>

<p>I told her I was after Miss Drummond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what may be your business with Miss Drummond?&rdquo;
says she.</p>

<p>I told her I had met her on Saturday last, had been
so fortunate as to render her a trifling service, and was
come now on the young lady&rsquo;s invitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, so you&rsquo;re Saxpence!&rdquo; she cried, with a very
sneering manner. &ldquo;A braw gift, a bonny gentleman.
And hae ye ony ither name and designation, or were ye
bapteesed Saxpence?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>I told my name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Preserve me!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Has Ebenezer gotten
a son?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I am a son of Alexander&rsquo;s.
It&rsquo;s I that am the Laird of Shaws.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll find your work cut out for ye to establish that,&rdquo;
quoth she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I perceive you know my uncle,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and I
daresay you may be the better pleased to hear that business
is arranged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what brings ye here after Miss Drummond?&rdquo;
she pursued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m come after my saxpence, mem,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
to be thought, being my uncle&rsquo;s nephew, I would be found
a careful lad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So ye have a spark of sleeness in ye?&rdquo; observed the
old lady, with some approval. &ldquo;I thought ye had just
been a cuif&mdash;you and your saxpence, and your <i>lucky day</i>
and your <i>sake of Balwhidder</i>&rdquo;&mdash;from which I was gratified
to learn that Catriona had not forgotten some of our talk.
&ldquo;But all this is by the purpose,&rdquo; she resumed. &ldquo;Am
I to understand that ye come here keeping company?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is surely rather an early question,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;The
maid is young, so am I, worse fortune. I have but seen
her the once. I&rsquo;ll not deny,&rdquo; I added, making up my mind
to try her with some frankness, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not deny but she has
run in my head a good deal since I met in with her. That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"></a>62</span>
is one thing; but it would be quite another, and I think I
would look very like a fool, to commit myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can speak out of your mouth, I see,&rdquo; said the
old lady. &ldquo;Praise God, and so can I! I was fool enough
to take charge of this rogue&rsquo;s daughter: a fine charge
I have gotten; but it&rsquo;s mine, and I&rsquo;ll carry it the way I
want to. Do ye mean to tell me, Mr. Balfour of Shaws,
that you would marry James More&rsquo;s daughter, and him
hanged? Well, then, where there&rsquo;s no possible marriage
there shall be no manner of carryings-on, and take that
for said. Lasses are bruckle things,&rdquo; she added, with a
nod; &ldquo;and though ye would never think it by my wrunkled
chafts, I was a lassie mysel&rsquo;, and a bonny one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lady Allardyce,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for that I suppose to be
your name, you seem to do the two sides of the talking,
which is a very poor manner to come to an agreement.
You give me rather a home-thrust when you ask if I would
marry, at the gallows&rsquo; foot, a young lady whom I have seen
but the once. I have told you already I would never be
so untenty as to commit myself. And yet I&rsquo;ll go some way
with you. If I continue to like the lass as well as I have
reason to expect, it will be something more than her father,
or the gallows either, that keeps the two of us apart. As
for my family, I found it by the wayside like a lost bawbee!
I owe less than nothing to my uncle; and if ever I marry,
it will be to please one person: that&rsquo;s myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard this kind of talk before ye were born,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Ogilvy, &ldquo;which is perhaps the reason that I think
of it so little. There&rsquo;s much to be considered. This James
More is a kinsman of mine, to my shame be it spoken. But
the better the family, the mair men hanged or heided, that&rsquo;s
always been poor Scotland&rsquo;s story. And if it was just the
hanging! For my part, I think I would be best pleased
with James upon the gallows, which would be at least
an end to him. Catrine&rsquo;s a good lass enough, and a good-hearted,
and lets herself be deaved all day with a runt
of an auld wife like me. But, ye see, there&rsquo;s the weak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63"></a>63</span>
bit. She&rsquo;s daft about that long, false, fleeching beggar
of a father of hers, and red-mad about the Gregara, and
proscribed names, and King James, and a wheen blethers.
And you might think ye could guide her, ye would find
yourself sore mista&rsquo;en. Ye say ye&rsquo;ve seen her but the
once....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spoke with her but the once, I should have said,&rdquo;
I interrupted. &ldquo;I saw her again this morning from a
window at Prestongrange&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This I daresay I put in because it sounded well; but I
was properly paid for my ostentation on the return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this of it?&rdquo; cries the old lady, with a sudden
pucker of her face. &ldquo;I think it was at the Advocate&rsquo;s
door-cheek that ye met her first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told her that was so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; she said; and then suddenly, upon rather
a scolding tone, &ldquo;I have your bare word for it,&rdquo; she cries,
&ldquo;as to who and what you are. By your way of it, you&rsquo;re
Balfour of the Shaws; but for what I ken you may be
Balfour of the Deevil&rsquo;s oxter. It&rsquo;s possible ye may come
here for what ye say, and it&rsquo;s equally possible ye may come
here for deil care what! I&rsquo;m good enough Whig to sit quiet,
and to have keepit all my men-folk&rsquo;s heads upon their
shoulders. But I&rsquo;m not just a good enough Whig to be
made a fool of neither. And I tell you fairly, there&rsquo;s too
much Advocate&rsquo;s door and Advocate&rsquo;s window here for
a man that comes taigling after a Macgregor&rsquo;s daughter.
Ye can tell that to the Advocate that sent ye, with my fond
love. And I kiss my loof to ye, Mr. Balfour,&rdquo; says she,
suiting the action to the word; &ldquo;and a braw journey to ye
back to where ye cam frae.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you think me a spy,&rdquo; I broke out, and speech
stuck in my throat. I stood and looked murder at the
old lady for a space, then bowed and turned away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here! Hoots! The callant&rsquo;s in a creel!&rdquo; she
cried. &ldquo;Think ye a spy? what else would I think ye&mdash;me
that kens naething by ye? But I see that I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64"></a>64</span>
wrong; and as I cannot fight, I&rsquo;ll have to apologise. A
bonny figure I would be with a broadsword. Ay! ay!&rdquo;
she went on, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re none such a bad lad in your way;
I think ye&rsquo;ll have some redeeming vices. But, O! Davit
Balfour, ye&rsquo;re damned countryfeed. Ye&rsquo;ll have to win
over that, lad; ye&rsquo;ll have to soople your backbone, and
think a wee pickle less of your dainty self; and ye&rsquo;ll have to
try to find out that women-folk are nae grenadiers. But
that can never be. To your last day you&rsquo;ll ken no more
of women-folk than what I do of sow-gelding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had never been used with such expressions from
a lady&rsquo;s tongue, the only two ladies I had known, Mrs.
Campbell and my mother, being most devout and most
particular women; and I suppose my amazement must
have been depicted in my countenance, for Mrs. Ogilvy
burst forth suddenly in a fit of laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep me!&rdquo; she cried, struggling with her mirth,
&ldquo;you have the finest timber face&mdash;and you to marry
the daughter of a Hieland cateran! Davie, my dear,
I think we&rsquo;ll have to make a match of it&mdash;if it was just
to see the weans. And now,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
no manner of service in your daidling here, for the young
woman is from home, and it&rsquo;s my fear that the old woman
is no suitable companion for your father&rsquo;s son. Forbye
that I have nobody but myself to look after my reputation,
and have been long enough alone with a sedooctive youth.
And come back another day for your saxpence!&rdquo; she cried
after me as I left.</p>

<p>My skirmish with this disconcerting lady gave my
thoughts a boldness they had otherwise wanted. For
two days the image of Catriona had mixed in all my meditations;
she made their background, so that I scarce enjoyed
my own company without a glint of her in a corner of my
mind. But now she came immediately near; I seemed
to touch her, whom I had never touched but the once;
I let myself flow out to her in a happy weakness, and looking
all about, and before and behind, saw the world like an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"></a>65</span>
undesirable desert, where men go as soldiers on a march,
following their duty with what constancy they have, and
Catriona alone there to offer me some pleasure of my days.
I wondered at myself that I could dwell on such considerations
in that time of my peril and disgrace; and when I
remembered my youth I was ashamed. I had my studies
to complete; I had to be called into some useful business;
I had yet to take my part of service in a place where all
must serve; I had yet to learn, and know, and prove myself
a man; and I had so much sense as blush that I should be
already tempted with these further-on and holier delights
and duties. My education spoke home to me sharply; I
was never brought up on sugar-biscuits, but on the hard
food of the truth. I knew that he was quite unfit to be a
husband who was not prepared to be a father also; and for
a boy like me to play the father was a mere derision.</p>

<p>When I was in the midst of these thoughts, and about
half-way back to town, I saw a figure coming to meet me,
and the trouble of my heart was heightened. It seemed
I had everything in the world to say to her, but nothing to
say first; and remembering how tongue-tied I had been
that morning at the Advocate&rsquo;s, I made sure that I would
find myself struck dumb. But when she came up my fears
fled away; not even the consciousness of what I had been
privately thinking disconcerted me the least; and I found
I could talk with her as easily and rationally as I might
with Alan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;you have been seeking your sixpence:
did you get it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told her, no; but now I had met with her, my walk
was not in vain. &ldquo;Though I have seen you to-day already,&rdquo;
said I, and told her where and when.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not see you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My eyes are big,
but there are better than mine at seeing far. Only I
heard singing in the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was Miss Grant,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the eldest and the
bonniest.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page66"></a>66</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They say they are all beautiful,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They think the same of you, Miss Drummond,&rdquo;
I replied, &ldquo;and were all crowding to the window to observe
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a pity about my being so blind,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;or
I might have seen them too.&mdash;And you were in the house?
You must have been having the fine time with the fine
music and the pretty ladies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is just where you are wrong,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;for
I was as uncouth as a sea-fish upon the brae of a mountain.
The truth is that I am better fitted to go about with rudas
men than pretty ladies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I would think so too, at all events!&rdquo; said she,
at which we both of us laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a strange thing, now,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I am
not the least afraid with you, yet I could have run
from the Miss Grants. And I was afraid of your
cousin too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I think any man will be afraid of her,&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;My father is afraid of her himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The name of her father brought me to a stop, I looked
at her as she walked by my side; I recalled the man, and
the little I knew and the much I guessed of him; and,
comparing the one with the other, felt like a traitor to be
silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speaking of which,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I met your father no
later than this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; she cried, with a voice of joy that seemed
to mock at me. &ldquo;You saw James More? You will have
spoken with him, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did even that,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>Then I think things went the worst way for me that
was humanly possible. She gave me a look of mere
gratitude. &ldquo;Ah, thank you for that!&rdquo; says she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You thank me for very little,&rdquo; said I, and then stopped.
But it seemed when I was holding back so much, something
at least had to come out. &ldquo;I spoke rather ill to him,&rdquo; said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>67</span>
I; &ldquo;I did not like him very much; I spoke him rather ill,
and he was angry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you had little to do then, and less to tell it to
his daughter!&rdquo; she cried out. &ldquo;But those that do not love
and cherish him I will not know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will take the freedom of a word yet,&rdquo; said I, beginning
to tremble. &ldquo;Perhaps neither your father nor I
are in the best of good spirits at Prestongrange&rsquo;s. I daresay
we both have anxious business there, for it&rsquo;s a dangerous
house. I was sorry for him too, and spoke to him the first,
if I could but have spoken the wiser. And for one thing,
in my opinion, you will soon find that his affairs are
mending.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will not be through your friendship, I am thinking,&rdquo;
said she; &ldquo;and he is much made up to you for your
sorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Drummond,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;I am alone in this
world....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I am not wondering at that,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, let me speak!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I will speak but the
once, and then leave you, if you will, for ever. I came
this day in the hopes of a kind word that I am sore in want
of. I know that what I said must hurt you, and I knew
it then. It would have been easy to have spoken smooth,
easy to lie to you; can you not think how I was tempted
to the same? Cannot you see the truth of my heart shine
out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think here is a great deal of work, Mr. Balfour,&rdquo;
said she. &ldquo;I think we will have met but the once, and will
can part like gentle-folk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, let me have one to believe in me!&rdquo; I pleaded,
&ldquo;I canna bear it else. The whole world is clanned
against me. How am I to go through with my dreadful
fate? If there&rsquo;s to be none to believe in me, I cannot do
it. The man must just die, for I cannot do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had still looked straight in front of her, head in
air; but at my words or the tone of my voice she came to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68"></a>68</span>
a stop. &ldquo;What is this you say?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;What
are you talking of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is my testimony which may save an innocent
life,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and they will not suffer me to bear it. What
would you do yourself? You know what this is, whose
father lies in danger. Would you desert the poor soul?
They have tried all ways with me. They have sought
to bribe me; they offered me hills and valleys. And to-day
that sleuth-hound told me how I stood, and to what a length
he would go to butcher and disgrace me. I am to be brought
in a party to the murder; I am to have held Glenure in talk
for money and old clothes; I am to be killed and shamed.
If this is the way I am to fall, and me scarce a man&mdash;if
this is the story to be told of me in all Scotland&mdash;if you are
to believe it too, and my name is to be nothing but a byword&mdash;Catriona,
how can I go through with it? The
thing&rsquo;s not possible; it&rsquo;s more than a man has in his
heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I poured my words out in a whirl, one upon the other;
and when I stopped I found her gazing on me with a startled
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glenure! It is the Appin murder,&rdquo; she said softly,
but with a very deep surprise.</p>

<p>I had turned back to bear her company, and we were
now come near the head of the brae above Dean village.
At this word I stepped in front of her like one suddenly
distracted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;for God&rsquo;s sake, what is
this that I have done?&rdquo; and carried my fists to my temples.
&ldquo;What made me do it? Sure, I am bewitched to say these
things!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the name of heaven, what ails you now?&rdquo; she
cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I gave my honour,&rdquo; I groaned, &ldquo;I gave my honour,
and now I have broke it. O Catriona!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am asking you what it is,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;was it these
things you should not have spoken? And do you think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69"></a>69</span>
<i>I</i> have no honour, then? or that I am one that would betray
a friend? I hold up my right hand to you and swear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I knew you would be true!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me&mdash;it&rsquo;s
here. I that stood but this morning and outfaced them,
that risked rather to die disgraced upon the gallows than
do wrong&mdash;and a few hours after I throw my honour away
by the roadside in common talk! &lsquo;There is one thing clear
upon our interview,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;that I can rely on your
pledged word.&rsquo; Where is my word now? Who could
believe me now? <i>You</i> could not believe me. I am clean
fallen down; I had best die!&rdquo; All this I said with a weeping
voice, but I had no tears in my body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My heart is sore for you,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but be sure
you are too nice. I would not believe you, do you say?
I would trust you with anything. And these men? I
would not be thinking of them! Men who go about to
entrap and to destroy you! Fy! this is no time to crouch.
Look up! Do you not think I will be admiring you like
a great hero of the good&mdash;and you a boy not much older than
myself? And because you said a word too much in a friend&rsquo;s
ear, that would die ere she betrayed you&mdash;to make such a
matter! It is one thing that we must both forget.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catriona,&rdquo; said I, looking at her, hang-dog, &ldquo;is this
true of it? Would ye trust me yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you not believe the tears upon my face?&rdquo; she
cried. &ldquo;It is the world I am thinking of you, Mr. David
Balfour. Let them hang you; I will never forget, I will
grow old and still remember you. I think it is great to die
so; I will envy you that gallows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And maybe all this while I am but a child frighted
with bogles,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Maybe they but make a mock
of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is what I must know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I must hear
the whole. The harm is done, at all events, and I must
hear the whole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had sat down on the wayside, where she took a place
beside me, and I told her all that matter much as I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70"></a>70</span>
written it, my thoughts about her father&rsquo;s dealing being
alone omitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, when I had finished, &ldquo;you are a hero,
surely, and I never would have thought that same! And
I think you are in peril, too. O, Simon Fraser! to think
upon that man! For his life and the dirty money, to be
dealing in such traffic!&rdquo; And just then she called out
aloud with a queer word that was common with her, and
belongs, I believe, to her own language. &ldquo;My torture!&rdquo;
says she, &ldquo;look at the sun!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed, it was already dipping towards the mountains.</p>

<p>She bid me come again soon, gave me her hand, and left
me in a turmoil of glad spirits. I delayed to go home
to my lodging, for I had a terror of immediate arrest; but
got some supper at a change-house, and the better part
of that night walked by myself in the barley-fields, and had
such a sense of Catriona&rsquo;s presence that I seemed to bear
her in my arms.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<h5>THE BRAVO</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> next day, August 29th, I kept my appointment at the
Advocate&rsquo;s in a coat that I had made to my own measure,
and was but newly ready.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aha,&rdquo; says Prestongrange, &ldquo;you are very fine to-day;
my misses are to have a fine cavalier. Come, I take
that kind of you. I take that kind of you, Mr. David.
O, we shall do very well yet, and I believe your troubles
are nearly at an end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have news for me?&rdquo; cried I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beyond anticipation,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Your testimony
is after all to be received; and you may go, if you will,
in my company to the trial, which is to be held at Inverary,
Thursday, 21st <i>proximo</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was too much amazed to find words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the meanwhile,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;though I will
not ask you to renew your pledge, I must caution you
strictly to be reticent. To-morrow your precognition
must be taken; and outside of that, do you know, I
think least said will be soonest mended.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall try to go discreetly,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I believe it
is yourself that I must thank for this crowning mercy,
and I do thank you gratefully. After yesterday, my lord,
this is like the doors of heaven. I cannot find it in my heart
to get the thing believed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but you must try and manage, you must try
and manage to believe it,&rdquo; says he, soothing-like, &ldquo;and
I am very glad to hear your acknowledgment of obligation,
for I think you may be able to repay me very shortly&rdquo;&mdash;he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"></a>72</span>
coughed&mdash;&ldquo;or even now. The matter is much
changed. Your testimony, which I shall not trouble you
for to-day, will doubtless alter the complexion of the case
for all concerned, and this makes it less delicate for me to
enter with you on a side issue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; I interrupted, &ldquo;excuse me for interrupting
you, but how has this been brought about? The
obstacles you told me of on Saturday appeared even to me
to be quite insurmountable; how has it been contrived?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Mr. David,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it would never do
for me to divulge (even to you, as you say) the councils
of the Government; and you must content yourself, if
you please, with the gross fact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled upon me like a father as he spoke, playing
the while with a new pen; methought it was impossible
there could be any shadow of deception in the man: yet
when he drew to him a sheet of paper, dipped his pen
among the ink, and began again to address me, I was somehow
not so certain, and fell instinctively into an attitude
of guard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a point I wish to touch upon,&rdquo; he began.
&ldquo;I purposely left it before upon one side, which need
be now no longer necessary. This is not, of course, a
part of your examination, which is to follow by another
hand; this is a private interest of my own.&mdash;You say
you encountered Alan Breck upon the hill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did, my lord,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was immediately after the murder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you speak to him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had known him before, I think?&rdquo; says my lord
carelessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot guess your reason for so thinking, my lord,&rdquo;
I replied, &ldquo;but such is the fact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when did you part with him again?&rdquo; said
he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page73"></a>73</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I reserve my answer,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;The question will
be put to me at the assize.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Balfour,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;will you not understand
that all this is without prejudice to yourself? I have
promised you life and honour; and, believe me, I can
keep my word. You are therefore clear of all anxiety.
Alan, it appears, you suppose you can protect; and you
talk to me of your gratitude, which I think (if you push
me) is not ill-deserved. There are a great many different
considerations all pointing the same way; and I will never
be persuaded that you could not help us (if you chose)
to put salt on Alan&rsquo;s tail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I give you my word I do not so
much as guess where Alan is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused a breath. &ldquo;Nor how he might be found?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p>I sat before him like a log of wood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so much for your gratitude, Mr. David!&rdquo; he
observed. Again there was a piece of silence. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
said he, rising, &ldquo;I am not fortunate, and we are a couple
at cross-purposes. Let us speak of it no more; you will
receive notice when, where, and by whom, we are to take
your precognition. And in the meantime, my misses must
be waiting you. They will never forgive me if I detain their
cavalier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Into the hands of these Graces I was accordingly offered
up, and found them dressed beyond what I had thought
possible, and looking fair as a posy.</p>

<p>As we went forth from the doors a small circumstance
occurred which came afterwards to look extremely big.
I heard a whistle sound loud and brief like a signal, and,
looking all about, spied for one moment the red head of
Neil of the Tom, the son of Duncan. The next moment
he was gone again, nor could I see so much as the skirt-tail
of Catriona, upon whom I naturally supposed him to be
then attending.</p>

<p>My three keepers led me out by Bristo and the Bruntsfield
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74"></a>74</span>
Links; whence a path carried us to Hope Park,
a beautiful pleasance, laid with gravel-walks, furnished
with seats and summer-sheds, and warded by a keeper.
The way there was a little longsome; the two younger
misses affected an air of genteel weariness that damped me
cruelly, the eldest considered me with something that at
times appeared like mirth; and though I thought I did
myself more justice than the day before, it was not without
some effort. Upon our reaching the park I was launched
on a bevy of eight or ten young gentlemen (some of them
cockaded officers, the rest chiefly advocates) who crowded
to attend upon these beauties; and though I was presented
to all of them in very good words, it seemed I was by all
immediately forgotten. Young folk in a company are like
to savage animals: they fall upon or scorn a stranger without
civility, or I may say, humanity; and I am sure, if I
had been among baboons, they would have shown me quite
as much of both. Some of the advocates set up to be
wits, and some of the soldiers to be rattles; and I could
not tell which of these extremes annoyed me most. All
had a manner of handling their swords and coat-skirts,
for the which (in mere black envy) I could have kicked
them from that park. I daresay, upon their side, they
grudged me extremely the fine company in which I had
arrived; and altogether I had soon fallen behind, and
stepped stiffly in the rear of all that merriment with my
own thoughts.</p>

<p>From these I was recalled by one of the officers,
Lieutenant Hector Duncansby, a gawky, leering Highland
boy, asking if my name was not &ldquo;Palfour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told him it was, not very kindly, for his manner was
scant civil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha, Palfour,&rdquo; says he, and then, repeating it, &ldquo;Palfour,
Palfour!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid you do not like my name, sir,&rdquo; says I,
annoyed with myself to be annoyed with such a rustical
fellow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75"></a>75</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;but I wass thinking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not advise you to make a practice of that,
sir,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;I feel sure you would not find it to agree
with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tit you effer hear where Alan Grigor fand the tangs?&rdquo;
said he.</p>

<p>I asked him what he could possibly mean, and he
answered, with a heckling laugh, that he thought I must
have found the poker in the same place and swallowed it.</p>

<p>There could be no mistake about this, and my cheek
burned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before I went about to put affronts on gentlemen,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;I think I would learn the English language first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took me by the sleeve with a nod and a wink, and
led me quietly outside Hope Park. But no sooner were we
beyond the view of the promenaders than the fashion of his
countenance changed. &ldquo;You tam lowland scoon&rsquo;rel!&rdquo;
cries he, and hit me a buffet on the jaw with his closed fist.</p>

<p>I paid him as good or better on the return; whereupon
he stepped a little back and took off his hat to me
decorously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough plows, I think,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;I will be the
offended shentleman, for who effer heard of such suffeeciency
as tell a shentlemans that is the King&rsquo;s officer
he canna speak Cot&rsquo;s English? We have swords at our
hurdies, and here is the King&rsquo;s Park at hand. Will ye
walk first, or let me show ye the way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I returned his bow, told him to go first, and followed
him. As he went I heard him grumble to himself about
<i>Cot&rsquo;s English</i> and the <i>King&rsquo;s coat</i>, so that I might have
supposed him to be seriously offended. But his manner
at the beginning of our interview was there to belie him.
It was manifest he had come prepared to fasten a quarrel
on me, right or wrong; manifest that I was taken in a
fresh contrivance of my enemies; and to me (conscious
as I was of my deficiencies) manifest enough that I should
be the one to fall in our encounter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page76"></a>76</span></p>

<p>As we came into that rough, rocky desert of the King&rsquo;s
Park I was tempted half a dozen times to take to my heels
and run for it, so loath was I to show my ignorance in
fencing, and so much averse to die or even to be wounded.
But I considered if their malice went as far as this, it would
likely stick at nothing; and that to fall by the sword,
however ungracefully, was still an improvement on the
gallows. I considered, besides, that by the unguarded
pertness of my words and the quickness of my blow, I had
put myself quite out of court; and that even if I ran,
my adversary would probably pursue and catch me, which
would add disgrace to my misfortune. So that, taking
all in all, I continued marching behind him, much as
a man follows the hangman, and certainly with no
more hope.</p>

<p>We went about the end of the long craigs, and came
into the Hunter&rsquo;s Bog. Here, on a piece of fair turf, my
adversary drew. There was nobody there to see us but
some birds; and no resource for me but to follow his
example, and stand on guard with the best face I could
display. It seems it was not good enough for Mr. Duncansby,
who spied some flaw in my manoeuvres, paused,
looked upon me sharply, and came off and on, and menaced
me with his blade in the air. As I had seen no such proceedings
from Alan, and was besides a good deal affected with
the proximity of death, I grew quite bewildered, stood
helpless, and could have longed to run away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fat deil ails her?&rdquo; cries the lieutenant.</p>

<p>And suddenly engaging, he twitched the sword out
of my grasp, and sent it flying far among the rushes.</p>

<p>Twice was this manoevure repeated; and the third
time, when I brought back my humiliated weapon, I found
he had returned his own to the scabbard, and stood awaiting
me with a face of some anger, and his hands clasped under
his skirt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pe tamned if I touch you!&rdquo; he cried, and asked me
bitterly what right I had to stand up before &ldquo;shentlemans&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"></a>77</span>
when I did not know the back of a sword from the
front of it.</p>

<p>I answered that was the fault of my upbringing; and
would he do me the justice to say I had given him all the
satisfaction it was unfortunately in my power to offer, and
had stood up like a man?</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that is the truth,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I am fery prave
myself, and pold as a lions. But to stand up there&mdash;and
you ken naething of fence!&mdash;the way that you did,
I declare it was peyond me. And I am sorry for the plow;
though I declare I pelief your own was the elder brother, and
my heid still sings with it. And I declare if I had kent what
way it wass, I would not put a hand to such a piece of
pusiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is handsomely said,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;and I am
sure you will not stand up a second time to be the actor
for my private enemies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, no, Palfour,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and I think I wass
used extremely suffeeciently myself to be set up to fecht
with an auld wife, or all the same as a bairn whateffer!
And I will tell the Master so, and fecht him, by Cot, himself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if you knew the nature of Mr. Simon&rsquo;s quarrel
with me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you would be yet the more affronted
to be mingled up with such affairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He swore he could well believe it; that all the Lovats
were made of the same meal and the devil was the miller
that ground that; then suddenly shaking me by the hand,
he vowed I was a pretty enough fellow after all, that it was a
thousand pities I had been neglected, and that if he could
find the time he would give an eye himself to have me
educated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can do me a better service than even what
you propose,&rdquo; said I; and when he had asked its nature&mdash;&ldquo;Come
with me to the house of one of my enemies,
and testify how I have carried myself this day,&rdquo; I told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be the true service. For though he has sent
me a gallant adversary for the first, the thought in Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78"></a>78</span>
Simon&rsquo;s mind is merely murder. There will be a second
and then a third; and by what you have seen of my cleverness
with the cold steel, you can judge for yourself what is
like to be the upshot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I would not like it myself, if I wass no more
of a man than what you wass!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;But I will
do you right, Palfour. Lead on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>If I had walked slowly on the way into that accursed
park, my heels were light enough on the way out. They
kept time to a very good old air, that is as ancient as the
Bible, and the words of it are: &ldquo;<i>Surely the bitterness of
death is past.</i>&rdquo; I mind that I was extremely thirsty, and
had a drink at St. Margaret&rsquo;s Well on the road down, and
the sweetness of that water passed belief. We went through
the Sanctuary, up the Canongate, in by the Nether Bow,
and straight to Prestongrange&rsquo;s door, talking as we came,
and arranging the details of our affair. The footman owned
his master was at home, but declared him engaged with
other gentlemen on very private business, and his door
forbidden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My business is but for three minutes, and it cannot
wait,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;You may say it is by no means private,
and I shall be even glad to have some witnesses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the man departed unwillingly enough upon this
errand, we made so bold as to follow him to the antechamber,
whence I could hear for a while the murmuring
of several voices in the room within. The truth is, they
were three at the one table&mdash;Prestongrange, Simon Fraser,
and Mr. Erskine, Sheriff of Perth; and as they were met
in consultation on the very business of the Appin murder,
they were a little disturbed at my appearance, but decided
to receive me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, Mr. Balfour, and what brings you here
again? and who is this you bring with you?&rdquo; says
Prestongrange.</p>

<p>As for Fraser, he looked before him on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is here to bear a little testimony in my favour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79"></a>79</span>
my lord, which I think it very needful you should hear,&rdquo;
said I, and turned to Duncansby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have only to say this,&rdquo; said the lieutenant, &ldquo;that
I stood up this day with Palfour in the Hunter&rsquo;s Pog,
which I am now fery sorry for, and he behaved himself
as pretty as a shentlemans could ask it. And I have creat
respects for Palfour,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you for your honest expressions,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>Whereupon Duncansby made his bow to the company,
and left the chamber, as we had agreed upon before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have I to do with this?&rdquo; says Prestongrange.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell your lordship in two words,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I
have brought this gentleman, a King&rsquo;s officer, to do me
so much justice. Now I think my character is covered,
and until a certain date, which your lordship can very
well supply, it will be quite in vain to despatch against
me any more officers. I will not consent to fight my way
through the garrison of the castle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The veins swelled on Prestongrange&rsquo;s brow, and he
regarded me with fury.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think the devil uncoupled this dog of a lad between
my legs!&rdquo; he cried; and then, turning fiercely on his
neighbour, &ldquo;This is some of your work, Simon,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I spy your hand in the business, and, let me tell you,
I resent it. It is disloyal, when we are agreed upon one
expedient, to follow another in the dark. You are disloyal
to me. What! you let me send this lad to the place with
my very daughters! And because I let drop a word to
you.... Fy, sir, keep your dishonours to yourself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Simon was deadly pale. &ldquo;I will be a kick-ball between
you and the Duke no longer,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Either
come to an agreement, or come to a differ, and have it out
among yourselves. But I will no longer fetch and carry,
and get your contrary instructions, and be blamed by both.
For if I were to tell you what I think of all your Hanover
business it would make your head sing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Sheriff Erskine had preserved his temper, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"></a>80</span>
now intervened smoothly. &ldquo;And in the meantime,&rdquo; says
he, &ldquo;I think we should tell Mr. Balfour that his character
for valour is quite established. He may sleep in peace.
Until the date he was so good as to refer to, it shall be
put to the proof no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His coolness brought the others to their prudence;
and they made haste, with a somewhat distracted civility,
to pack me from the house.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<h5>THE HEATHER ON FIRE</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">When</span> I left Prestongrange that afternoon I was for the
first time angry. The Advocate had made a mock of me.
He had pretended my testimony was to be received and
myself respected; and in that very hour, not only was
Simon practising against my life by the hands of the
Highland soldier, but (as appeared from his own language)
Prestongrange himself had some design in operation.
I counted my enemies: Prestongrange with all the King&rsquo;s
authority behind him; and the Duke with the power of the
West Highlands; and the Lovat interest by their side to
help them with so great a force in the north, and the whole
clan of old Jacobite spies and traffickers. And when I
remembered James More, and the red head of Neil the son
of Duncan, I thought there was perhaps a fourth in the
confederacy, and what remained of Rob Roy&rsquo;s old desperate
sept of caterans would be banded against me with the others.
One thing was requisite&mdash;some strong friend or wise adviser.
The country must be full of such, both able and eager to
support me, or Lovat and the Duke and Prestongrange
had not been nosing for expedients; and it made me rage
to think that I might brush against my champions in the
street and be no wiser.</p>

<p>And just then (like an answer) a gentleman brushed
against me going by, gave me a meaning look, and turned
into a close. I knew him with the tail of my eye&mdash;it was
Stewart the Writer; and, blessing my good fortune, turned
in to follow him. As soon as I had entered the close I saw
him standing in the mouth of a stair, where he made me a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82"></a>82</span>
signal and immediately vanished. Seven stories up, there
he was again in a house-door, the which he locked behind
us after we had entered. The house was quite dismantled,
with not a stick of furniture; indeed, it was one of which
Stewart had the letting in his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to sit upon the floor,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;re
safe here for the time being, and I&rsquo;ve been wearying to see
ye, Mr. Balfour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s it with Alan?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brawly,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Andie picks him up at Gillane
Sands to-morrow, Wednesday. He was keen to say good-bye
to ye, but, the way that things were going, I was
feared the pair of ye was maybe best apart. And that
brings me to the essential: how does your business
speed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I was told only this morning that
my testimony was accepted, and I was to travel to Inverary
with the Advocate, no less.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hout awa!&rdquo; cried Stewart. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never believe
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have maybe a suspicion of my own,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;but
I would like fine to hear your reasons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I tell ye fairly, I&rsquo;m horn-mad,&rdquo; cries Stewart.
&ldquo;If my one hand could pull their Government down I
would pluck it like a rotten apple. I&rsquo;m doer for Appin
and for James of the Glens; and, of course, it&rsquo;s my duty
to defend my kinsman for his life. Hear how it goes with
me, and I&rsquo;ll leave the judgment of it to yourself. The
first thing they have to do is to get rid of Alan. They
canna bring in James as art and part until they&rsquo;ve brought
in Alan first as principal; that&rsquo;s sound law: they could
never put the cart before the horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how are they to bring in Alan till they can catch
him?&rdquo; says I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but there is a way to evite that arrestment,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;Sound law, too. It would be a bonny thing
if, by the escape of one ill-doer another was to go scatheless,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83"></a>83</span>
and the remeid is to summon the principal and put him
to outlawry for the non-compearance. Now there&rsquo;s four
places where a person can be summoned: at his dwelling-house;
at a place where he has resided forty days; at the
head burgh of the shire where he ordinarily resorts; or
lastly (if there be ground to think him furth of Scotland)
<i>at the cross of Edinburgh, and the pier and shore of Leith, for
sixty days</i>. The purpose of which last provision is evident
upon its face: being that outgoing ships may have time to
carry news of the transaction, and the summoning be something
other than a form. Now take the case of Alan. He
has no dwelling-house that ever I could hear of; I would
be obliged if any one would show me where he has lived
forty days together since the &rsquo;Forty-five; there is no shire
where he resorts, whether ordinarily or extraordinarily;
if he has a domicile at all, which I misdoubt, it must be
with his regiment in France; and if he is not yet furth of
Scotland (as we happen to know and they happen to guess)
it must be evident to the most dull it&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s aiming for.
Where, then, and what way should he be summoned? I
ask it at yourself, a layman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have given the very words,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Here
at the cross, and at the pier and shore of Leith, for sixty
days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re a sounder Scots lawyer than Prestongrange,
then!&rdquo; cries the Writer. &ldquo;He has had Alan summoned
once; that was on the twenty-fifth, the day that we first
met. Once, and done with it. And where? Where,
but at the cross of Inverary, the head burgh of the Campbells?
A word in your ear, Mr. Balfour&mdash;they&rsquo;re not seeking
Alan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Not seeking him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the best that I can make of it,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Not
wanting to find him, in my poor thought. They think
perhaps he might set up a fair defence, upon the back of
which James, the man they&rsquo;re really after, might climb out.
This is not a case, ye see, it&rsquo;s a conspiracy.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"></a>84</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet I can tell you Prestongrange asked after Alan
keenly,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;though, when I come to think of it, he
was something of the easiest put by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See that,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;But there! I may be right
or wrong, that&rsquo;s guesswork at the best, and let me get
to my facts again. It comes to my ears that James and
the witnesses&mdash;the witnesses, Mr. Balfour!&mdash;lay in close
dungeons, and shackled forbye, in the military prison at
Fort William; none allowed in to them, nor they to write.
The witnesses, Mr. Balfour; heard ye ever the match of
that? I assure ye, no old, crooked Stewart of the gang
ever outfaced the law more impudently. It&rsquo;s clean in the
two eyes of the Act of Parliament of 1700, anent wrongous
imprisonment. No sooner did I get the news than I
petitioned the Lord Justice-Clerk. I have his word to-day.
There&rsquo;s law for ye! here&rsquo;s justice!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He put a paper in my hand, that same mealy-mouthed,
false-faced paper that was printed since in the pamphlet
&ldquo;by a bystander,&rdquo; for behoof (as the title says) of James&rsquo;s
&ldquo;poor widow and five children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said Stewart, &ldquo;he couldn&rsquo;t dare to refuse me
access to my client, so he <i>recommends the commanding
officer to let me in</i>. Recommends!&mdash;the Lord Justice-Clerk
of Scotland recommends. Is not the purpose of such
language plain? They hope the officer may be so dull, or
so very much the reverse, as to refuse the recommendation.
I would have to make the journey back again betwixt here
and Fort William. Then would follow a fresh delay till I
got fresh authority, and they had disavowed the officer&mdash;military
man, notoriously ignorant of the law, and that&mdash;I
ken the cant of it. Then the journey a third time; and
there we should be on the immediate heels of the trial
before I had received my first instruction. Am I not right
to call this a conspiracy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will bear that colour,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll go on to prove it you outright,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;They have the right to hold James in prison, yet they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85"></a>85</span>
cannot deny me to visit him. They have no right to hold
the witnesses; but am I to get a sight of them, that should
be as free as the Lord Justice-Clerk himself? See&mdash;read:
<i>For the rest, refuses to give any orders to keepers of prisons
who are not accused as having done anything contrary to the
duties of their office.</i> Anything contrary! Sirs! And the
Act of seventeen hunner? Mr. Balfour, this makes my
heart to burst; the heather is on fire inside my wame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the plain English of that phrase,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is
that the witnesses are still to lie in prison, and you are not
to see them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I am not to see them until Inverary, when the
court is set!&rdquo; cries he, &ldquo;and then to hear Prestongrange
upon <i>the anxious responsibilities of his office and the great
facilities afforded the defence</i>! But I&rsquo;ll begowk them there,
Mr. David. I have a plan to waylay the witnesses upon
the road, and see if I canna get a little harle of justice out
of the <i>military man notoriously ignorant of the law</i> that
shall command the party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was actually so&mdash;it was actually on the wayside near
Tyndrum, and by the connivance of a soldier officer, that
Mr. Stewart first saw the witnesses upon the case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing that would surprise me in this
business,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll surprise you ere I&rsquo;m done!&rdquo; cries he. &ldquo;Do ye see
this?&rdquo;&mdash;producing a print still wet from the press. &ldquo;This
is the libel: see, there&rsquo;s Prestongrange&rsquo;s name to the list of
witnesses, and I find no word of any Balfour. But here is
not the question. Who do ye think paid for the printing of
this paper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it would likely be King George,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it happens it was me!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Not but it
was printed by and for themselves, for the Grants and the
Erskines, and yon thief of the black midnight, Simon
Fraser. But could <i>I</i> win to get a copy? No! I was to go
blindfold to my defence; I was to hear the charges for the
first time in court alongst the jury.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page86"></a>86</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Is not this against the law?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot say so much,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;It was a favour
so natural and so constantly rendered (till this nonesuch
business) that the law has never looked to it. And now
admire the hand of Providence! A stranger is in Fleming&rsquo;s
printing-house, spies a proof on the floor, picks it up, and
carries it to me. Of all things, it was just this libel.
Whereupon I had it set again&mdash;printed at the expense of
the defence: <i>sumptibus moesti rei</i>: heard ever man the like
of it?&mdash;and here it is for anybody, the muckle secret out&mdash;all
may see it now. But how do you think I would enjoy
this, that has the life of my kinsman on my conscience?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Troth, I think you would enjoy it ill,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now you see how it is,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;and why,
when you tell me your evidence is to be let in, I laugh aloud
in your face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was now my turn. I laid before him in brief
Mr. Simon&rsquo;s threats and offers, and the whole incident of
the bravo, with the subsequent scene at Prestongrange&rsquo;s.
Of my first talk, according to promise, I said nothing, nor
indeed was it necessary. All the time I was talking
Stewart nodded his head like a mechanical figure; and no
sooner had my voice ceased than he opened his mouth and
gave me his opinion in two words, dwelling strong on both
of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Disappear yourself,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not take you,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll carry you there,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;By my view of
it you&rsquo;re to disappear whatever. O, that&rsquo;s outside debate.
The Advocate, who is not without some spunks of a remainder
decency, has wrung your life-safe out of Simon
and the Duke. He has refused to put you on your trial,
and refused to have you killed; and there is the clue to
their ill words together, for Simon and the Duke can keep
faith with neither friend nor enemy. Ye&rsquo;re not to be tried
then, and ye&rsquo;re not to be murdered; but I&rsquo;m in bitter error
if ye&rsquo;re not to be kidnapped and carried away like the Lady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87"></a>87</span>
Grange. Bet me what ye please&mdash;there was their
<i>expedient</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You make me think,&rdquo; said I, and told him of the
whistle and the red-headed retainer, Neil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wherever James More is there&rsquo;s one big rogue, never
be deceived on that,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;His father was none so ill
a man, though a kenning on the wrong side of the law, and
no friend to my family, that I should waste my breath to be
defending him! But as for James, he&rsquo;s a brock and a
blagyard. I like the appearance of this red-headed Neil as
little as yourself. It looks uncanny: fiegh! it smells bad.
It was old Lovat that managed the Lady Grange affair; if
young Lovat is to handle yours, it&rsquo;ll be all in the family.
What&rsquo;s James More in prison for? The same offence:
abduction. His men have had practice in the business.
He&rsquo;ll be to lend them to be Simon&rsquo;s instruments; and the
next thing we&rsquo;ll be hearing, James will have made his peace,
or else he&rsquo;ll have escaped; and you&rsquo;ll be in Benbecula or
Applecross.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye make a strong case,&rdquo; I admitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what I want,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;is that you should
disappear yourself ere they can get their hands upon ye.
Lie quiet until just before the trial, and spring upon them
at the last of it when they&rsquo;ll be looking for you least. This
is always supposing, Mr. Balfour, that your evidence is
worth so very great a measure of both risk and fash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you one thing,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I saw the murderer,
and it was not Alan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, by God, my cousin&rsquo;s saved!&rdquo; cried Stewart.
&ldquo;You have his life upon your tongue; and there&rsquo;s neither
time, risk, nor money to be spared to bring you to the trial.&rdquo;
He emptied his pockets on the floor. &ldquo;Here is all that I
have by me,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Take it, ye&rsquo;ll want it ere ye&rsquo;re
through. Go straight down this close, there&rsquo;s a way out by
there to the Lang Dykes, and by my will of it! see no more
of Edinburgh till the clash is over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where am I to go, then?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88"></a>88</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And I wish that I could tell ye!&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;but all the
places that I could send ye to would be just the places they
would seek. No, ye must fend for yourself, and God be your
guiding! Five days before the trial, September the sixteen,
get word to me at the &lsquo;King&rsquo;s Arms&rsquo; in Stirling;
and if ye&rsquo;ve managed for yourself as long as that, I&rsquo;ll see
that ye reach Inverary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One thing more,&rdquo; said I: &ldquo;Can I no&rsquo; see Alan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He seemed boggled. &ldquo;Hech, I would rather you
wouldna,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But I can never deny that Alan is
extremely keen of it, and is to lie this night by Silvermills
on purpose. If you&rsquo;re sure that you&rsquo;re not followed, Mr.
Balfour&mdash;but make sure of that,&mdash;lie in a good place and
watch your road for a clear hour before ye risk it. It
would be a dreadful business if both you and him was to
miscarry!&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>

<h5>THE RED-HEADED MAN</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">It</span> was about half-past three when I came forth on the Lang
Dykes. Dean was where I wanted to go. Since Catriona
dwelled there, and her kinsfolk the Glengyle Macgregors
appeared almost certainly to be employed against me, it
was just one of the few places I should have kept away
from; and being a very young man, and beginning to be
very much in love, I turned my face in that direction
without pause. As a salve to my conscience and common
sense, however, I took a measure of precaution. Coming
over the crown of a bit of a rise in the road, I clapped down
suddenly among the barley and lay waiting. After a while,
a man went by that looked to be a Highlandman, but I had
never seen him till that hour. Presently after came Neil of
the red head. The next to go past was a miller&rsquo;s cart, and
after that nothing but manifest country people. Here was
enough to have turned the most foolhardy from his purpose,
but my inclination ran too strong the other way. I argued
it out that if Neil was on that road, it was the right road to
find him in, leading direct to his chief&rsquo;s daughter; as for the
other Highlandman, if I was to be startled off by every
Highlandman I saw, I would scarce reach anywhere. And
having quite satisfied myself with this disingenuous debate,
I made the better speed of it, and came a little after four to
Mrs. Drummond-Ogilvy&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Both ladies were within the house; and upon my
perceiving them together by the open door, I plucked off
my hat and said, &ldquo;Here was a lad come seeking saxpence,&rdquo;
which I thought might please the dowager.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page90"></a>90</span></p>

<p>Catriona ran out to greet me heartily, and, to my surprise,
the old lady seemed scarce less forward than herself. I
learned long afterwards that she had despatched a horseman
by daylight to Rankeillor at the Queen&rsquo;s Ferry, whom she
knew to be the doer for Shaws, and had then in her pocket
a letter from that good friend of mine, presenting, in the
most favourable view, my character and prospects. But
had I read it I could scarce have seen more clear in her
designs. Maybe I was <i>countryfeed</i>; at least, I was not so
much so as she thought; and it was plain enough, even
to my homespun wits, that she was bent to hammer up a
match between her cousin and a beardless boy that was
something of a laird in Lothian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Saxpence had better take his broth with us, Catrine,&rdquo;
says she. &ldquo;Run and tell the lasses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And for the little while we were alone she was at a good
deal of pains to flatter me; always cleverly, always with
the appearance of a banter, still calling me Saxpence, but
with such a turn that should rather uplift me in my own
opinion. When Catriona returned, the design became if
possible more obvious; and she showed off the girl&rsquo;s
advantages like a horse-couper with a horse. My face
flamed that she should think me so obtuse. Now I would
fancy the girl was being innocently made a show of, and
then I could have beaten the old carline wife with a cudgel;
and now, that perhaps these two had set their heads together
to entrap me, and at that I sat and gloomed betwixt them
like the very image of ill-will. At last the match-maker
had a better device, which was to leave the pair of us alone.
When my suspicions are anyway roused it is sometimes a
little the wrong side of easy to allay them. But though I
knew what breed she was of, and that was a breed of thieves,
I could never look in Catriona&rsquo;s face and disbelieve her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must not ask?&rdquo; says she eagerly, the same moment
we were left alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but to-day I can talk with a free conscience,&rdquo; I
replied. &ldquo;I am lightened of my pledge, and indeed (after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91"></a>91</span>
what has come and gone since morning) I would not have
renewed it were it asked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My cousin will not be so long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I told her the tale of the lieutenant from the first
step to the last of it, making it as mirthful as I could, and,
indeed, there was matter of mirth in that absurdity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I think you will be as little fitted for the rudas
men as for the pretty ladies, after all!&rdquo; says she, when I
had done. &ldquo;But what was your father that he could not
learn you to draw the sword? It is most ungentle; I have
not heard the match of that in any one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is most misconvenient at least,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and I
think my father (honest man!) must have been wool-gathering
to learn me Latin in the place of it. But you see I do
the best I can, and just stand up like Lot&rsquo;s wife and let them
hammer at me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know what makes me smile?&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;Well, it is this. I am made this way, that I should have
been a man child. In my own thoughts it is so I am
always; and I go on telling myself about this thing that is
to befall and that. Then it comes to the place of the fighting,
and it comes over me that I am only a girl at all events,
and cannot hold a sword or give one good blow; and then
I have to twist my story round about, so that the fighting
is to stop, and yet me have the best of it, just like you and
the lieutenant; and I am the boy that makes the fine
speeches all through, like Mr. David Balfour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a bloodthirsty maid,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I know it is good to sew and spin, and to make
samplers,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but if you were to do nothing else
in the great world, I think you will say yourself it is a
driech business; and it is not that I want to kill, I think.
Did ever you kill any one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I have, as it chances. Two, no less, and me
still a lad that should be at the college,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;But
yet, in the look-back, I take no shame for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how did you feel, then&mdash;after it?&rdquo; she asked.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92"></a>92</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Deed, I sat down and grat like a bairn,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that, too,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I feel where these
tears should come from. And at any rate, I would not
wish to kill, only to be Catherine Douglas, that put her
arm through the staples of the bolt, where it was broken.
That is my chief hero. Would you not love to die so&mdash;for
your king?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Troth,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;my affection for my king, God
bless the puggy face of him! is under more control; and
I thought I saw death so near to me this day already,
that I am rather taken up with the notion of living.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the right mind of a man! Only
you must learn arms; I would not like to have a friend
that cannot strike. But it will not have been with the
sword that you killed these two?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, no,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but with a pair of pistols.
And a fortunate thing it was the men were so near-hand
to me, for I am about as clever with the pistols as I am
with the sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So then she drew from me the story of our battle in the
brig, which I had omitted in my first account of my affairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you are brave. And your friend,
I admire and love him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and I think any one would!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;He
has his faults, like other folk; but he is brave and staunch
and kind, God bless him! That will be a strange day when
I forget Alan.&rdquo; And the thought of him, and that it was
within my choice to speak with him that night, had almost
overcome me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where will my head be gone that I have not
told my news!&rdquo; she cried, and spoke of a letter from
her father, bearing that she might visit him to-morrow
in the castle, whither he was now transferred, and that
his affairs were mending. &ldquo;You do not like to hear it,&rdquo;
said she. &ldquo;Will you judge my father and not know him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a thousand miles from judging,&rdquo; I replied.
&ldquo;And I give you my word I do rejoice to know your heart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93"></a>93</span>
is lightened. If my face fell at all, as I suppose it must,
you will allow this is rather an ill day for compositions,
and the people in power extremely ill persons to be compounding
with. I have Simon Fraser extremely heavy on
my stomach still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;you will not be evening these
two; and you should bear in mind that Prestongrange
and James More, my father, are of the one blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never heard tell of that,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is rather singular how little you are acquainted
with,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;One part may call themselves Grant,
and one Macgregor, but they are still of the same clan.
They are all the sons of Alpin, from whom, I think, our
country has its name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What country is that?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My country and yours,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is my day for discoveries, I think,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for
I always thought the name of it was Scotland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scotland is the name of what you call Ireland,&rdquo; she
replied. &ldquo;But the old ancient true name of this place
that we have our foot-soles on, and that our bones are
made of, will be Alban. It was Alban they called it when
our forefathers will be fighting for it against Rome and
Alexander; and it is called so still in your own tongue that
you forget.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Troth,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and that I never learned!&rdquo; For
I lacked heart to take her up about the Macedonian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But your fathers and mothers talked it, one generation
with another,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;And it was sung about
the cradles before you or me were ever dreamed of; and
your name remembers it still. Ah, if you could talk that
language you would find me another girl. The heart speaks
in that tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had a meal with the two ladies, all very good, served
in fine old plate, and the wine excellent, for it seems that
Mrs. Ogilvy was rich. Our talk, too, was pleasant enough;
but as soon as I saw the sun decline sharply and the shadows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94"></a>94</span>
to run out long, I rose to take my leave. For my mind was
now made up to say farewell to Alan; and it was needful
I should see the trysting wood, and reconnoitre it, by daylight.
Catriona came with me as far as to the garden gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is long till I see you now?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is beyond my judging,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;It will be
long, it may be never.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;And you are sorry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I bowed my head, looking upon her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I, at all events,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I have seen
you but a small time, but I put you very high. You
are true, you are brave; in time I think you will be more
of a man yet. I will be proud to hear of that. If you
should speed worse, if it will come to fall as we are afraid&mdash;O
well! think you have the one friend. Long after you
are dead, and me an old wife, I will be telling the bairns
about David Balfour, and my tears running. I will be
telling how we parted, and what I said to you, and did to
you. <i>God go with you, and guide you, prays your little
friend</i>: so I said&mdash;I will be telling them&mdash;and here is
what I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She took up my hand and kissed it. This so surprised
my spirits that I cried out like one hurt. The colour came
strong in her face, and she looked at me and nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O yes, Mr. David,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that is what I think
of you. The heart goes with the lips.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could read in her face high spirit, and a chivalry
like a brave child&rsquo;s; not anything besides. She kissed my
hand, as she had kissed Prince Charlie&rsquo;s, with a higher
passion than the common kind of clay has any sense of.
Nothing before had taught me how deep I was her lover,
nor how far I had yet to climb to make her think of me in
such a character. Yet I could tell myself I had advanced
some way, and that her heart had beat and her blood
flowed at thoughts of me.</p>

<p>After that honour she had done me I could offer no
more trivial civility. It was even hard for me to speak;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95"></a>95</span>
a certain lifting in her voice had knocked directly at the
door of my own tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I praise God for your kindness, dear,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Farewell,
my little friend!&rdquo; giving her that name which she
had given to herself; with which I bowed and left her.</p>

<p>My way was down the glen of the Leith river, towards
Stockbridge and Silvermills. A path led in the foot of it,
the water bickered and sang in the midst; the sunbeams
overhead struck out of the west among long shadows and
(as the valley turned) made like a new scene and a new
world of it at every corner. With Catriona behind and
Alan before me, I was like one lifted up. The place, besides,
and the hour, and the talking of the water, infinitely pleased
me; and I lingered in my steps and looked before and behind
me as I went. This was the cause, under Providence, that
I spied a little in my rear a red head among some bushes.</p>

<p>Anger sprang in my heart, and I turned straight about
and walked at a stiff pace to where I came from. The
path lay close by the bushes where I had remarked the
head. The cover came to the wayside, and as I passed
I was all strung up to meet and to resist an onfall. No
such thing befell, I went by unmeddled with; and at that,
fear increased upon me. It was still day indeed, but the
place exceeding solitary. If my haunters had let slip that
fair occasion I could but judge they aimed at something
more than David Balfour. The lives of Alan and James
weighed upon my spirit with the weight of two grown
bullocks.</p>

<p>Catriona was yet in the garden walking by herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catriona,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you see me back again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With a changed face,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I carry two men&rsquo;s lives besides my own,&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;It would be a sin and a shame not to walk carefully.
I was doubtful whether I did right to come here. I would
like it ill, if it was by that means we were brought to
harm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could tell you one that would be liking it less, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96"></a>96</span>
will like little enough to hear you talking at this very same
time,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;What have I done, at all events?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, you! you are not alone,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;But since
I went off I have been dogged again, and I can give you
the name of him that follows me. It is Neil, son of Duncan,
your man or your father&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure, you are mistaken there,&rdquo; she said, with
a white face. &ldquo;Neil is in Edinburgh on errands from my
father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is what I fear,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the last of it. But for his
being in Edinburgh I think I can show you another of
that. For sure you have some signal, a signal of need,
such as would bring him to your help, if he was anywhere
within the reach of ears and legs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how will you know that?&rdquo; says she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By means of a magical talisman God gave to me
when I was born, and the name they call it by is Common-sense,&rdquo;
said I. &ldquo;Oblige me so far as make your signal,
and I will show you the red head of Neil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No doubt but I spoke bitter and sharp. My heart
was bitter. I blamed myself and the girl and hated both
of us: her for the vile crew that she was come of, myself
for my wanton folly to have stuck my head in such a byke
of wasps.</p>

<p>Catriona set her fingers to her lips and whistled once,
with an exceeding clear, strong, mounting note, as full
as a ploughman&rsquo;s. A while we stood silent: and I was
about to ask her to repeat the same, when I heard the
sound of some one bursting through the bushes below on
the braeside. I pointed in that direction with a smile,
and presently Neil leaped into the garden. His eyes burned,
and he had a black knife (as they call it on the Highland
side) naked in his hand; but, seeing me beside his mistress,
stood like a man struck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has come to your call,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;judge how near
he was to Edinburgh, or what was the nature of your father&rsquo;s
errands. Ask himself. If I am to lose my life, or the lives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97"></a>97</span>
of those that hang by me, through the means of your clan,
let me go where I have to go with my eyes open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She addressed him tremulously in the Gaelic. Remembering
Alan&rsquo;s anxious civility in that particular, I
could have laughed out loud for bitterness; here, sure,
in the midst of these suspicions, was the hour she should
have stuck by English.</p>

<p>Twice or thrice they spoke together, and I could make
out that Neil (for all his obsequiousness) was an angry man.</p>

<p>Then she turned to me. &ldquo;He swears it is not,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catriona,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;do you believe the man yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She made a gesture like wringing the hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How will I can know?&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I must find some means to know,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I
cannot continue to go dovering round in the black night
with two men&rsquo;s lives at my girdle! Catriona, try to put
yourself in my place, as I vow to God I try hard to put
myself in yours. This is no kind of talk that should ever
have fallen between me and you; no kind of talk; my heart
is sick with it. See, keep him here till two of the morning,
and I care not. Try him with that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They spoke together once more in the Gaelic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He says he has James More my father&rsquo;s errand,&rdquo; said
she. She was whiter than ever, and her voice faltered as
she said it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is pretty plain now,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and may God forgive
the wicked!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She said never anything to that, but continued gazing
at me with the same white face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a fine business,&rdquo; said I again. &ldquo;Am I to fall,
then, and those two along with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what am I to do?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Could I go
against my father&rsquo;s orders, and him in prison, in the
danger of his life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But perhaps we go too fast,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;This may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98"></a>98</span>
a lie too. He may have no right orders; all may be contrived
by Simon, and your father knowing nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She burst out weeping between the pair of us; and
my heart smote me hard, for I thought this girl was in a
dreadful situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;keep him but the one hour; and I&rsquo;ll
chance it, and say God bless you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put out her hand to me. &ldquo;I will be needing one
good word,&rdquo; she sobbed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The full hour, then?&rdquo; said I, keeping her hand in
mine. &ldquo;Three lives of it, my lass!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The full hour!&rdquo; she said, and cried aloud on her
Redeemer to forgive her.</p>

<p>I thought it no fit place for me, and fled.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<h5>THE WOOD BY SILVERMILLS</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">I lost</span> no time, but down through the valley, and by
Stockbridge and Silvermills as hard as I could stave. It
was Alan&rsquo;s tryst to lie every night between twelve and
two &ldquo;in a bit scrog of wood by east of Silvermills, and
by south the south mill-lade.&rdquo; This I found easy enough,
where it grew on a steep brae, with the mill-lade flowing
swift and deep along the foot of it: and here I began to
walk slower and to reflect more reasonably on my employment.
I saw I had made but a fool&rsquo;s bargain with
Catriona. It was not to be supposed that Neil was sent
alone upon his errand, but perhaps he was the only man
belonging to James More; in which case, I should have
done all I could to hang Catriona&rsquo;s father, and nothing
the least material to help myself. To tell the truth, I
fancied neither one of these ideas. Suppose, by holding
back Neil, the girl should have helped to hang her father,
I thought she would never forgive herself this side of time.
And suppose there were others pursuing me that moment,
what kind of a gift was I come bringing to Alan? and how
would I like that?</p>

<p>I was up with the west end of that wood when these
two considerations struck me like a cudgel. My feet stopped
of themselves, and my heart along with them. &ldquo;What
wild game is this that I have been playing?&rdquo; thought I;
and turned instantly upon my heels to go elsewhere.</p>

<p>This brought my face to Silvermills; the path came
past the village with a crook, but all plainly visible; and,
Highland or Lowland, there was nobody stirring. Here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100"></a>100</span>
was my advantage, here was just such a conjuncture as
Stewart had counselled me to profit by, and I ran by the
side of the mill-lade, fetched about beyond the east corner
of the wood, threaded through the midst of it, and returned
to the west selvage, whence I could again command the path,
and yet be myself unseen. Again it was all empty, and my
heart began to rise.</p>

<p>For more than an hour I sat close in the border of the
trees, and no hare or eagle could have kept a more particular
watch. When that hour began the sun was already set,
but the sky still all golden and the daylight clear; before
the hour was done it had fallen to be half mirk, the images
and distances of things were mingled, and observation began
to be difficult. All that time not a foot of man had come
east from Silvermills, and the few that had gone west
were honest countryfolk and their wives upon the road
to bed. If I were tracked by the most cunning spies in
Europe, I judged it was beyond the course of nature they
could have any jealousy of where I was; and going a little
further home into the wood I lay down to wait for Alan.</p>

<p>The strain of my attention had been great, for I had
watched not the path only, but every bush and field within
my vision. That was now at an end. The moon, which
was in her first quarter, glinted a little in the wood; all
round there was a stillness of the country; and as I lay there
on my back, the next three or four hours, I had a fine
occasion to review my conduct.</p>

<p>Two things became plain to me first: that I had had
no right to go that day to Dean, and (having gone there)
had now no right to be lying where I was. This (where
Alan was to come) was just the one wood in all broad
Scotland that was, by every proper feeling, closed against
me; I admitted that, and yet stayed on, wondering at myself.
I thought of the measure with which I had meted to Catriona
that same night; how I had prated of the two lives I carried,
and had thus forced her to enjeopardy her father&rsquo;s; and
how I was here exposing them again, it seemed in wantonness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101"></a>101</span>
A good conscience is eight parts of courage. No
sooner had I lost conceit of my behaviour, than I seemed
to stand disarmed amidst a throng of terrors. Of a sudden
I sat up. How if I went now to Prestongrange, caught
him (as I still easily might) before he slept, and made a
full submission? Who could blame me? Not Stewart the
Writer; I had but to say that I was followed, despaired
of getting clear, and so gave in. Not Catriona: here, too,
I had my answer ready; that I could not bear she should
expose her father. So, in a moment, I could lay all these
troubles by, which were after all and truly none of mine;
swim clear of the Appin murder; get forth out of hand-stroke
of all the Stewarts and Campbells, all the Whigs
and Tories, in the land; and live thenceforth to my own
mind, and be able to enjoy and to improve my fortunes,
and devote some hours of my youth to courting Catriona,
which would be surely a more suitable occupation than to
hide and run and be followed like a hunted thief, and begin
over again the dreadful miseries of my escape with Alan.</p>

<p>At first I thought no shame of this capitulation; I was
only amazed I had not thought upon the thing and done it
earlier; and began to inquire into the causes of the change.
These I traced to my lowness of spirits, that back to my late
recklessness, and that again to the common, old, public,
disconsidered sin of self-indulgence. Instantly the text
came in my head, &ldquo;<i>How can Satan cast out Satan?&rdquo;</i>
What? (I thought) I had, by self-indulgence, and the following
of pleasant paths, and the lure of a young maid, cast
myself wholly out of conceit with my own character, and
jeopardised the lives of James and Alan? And I was to
seek the way out by the same road as I had entered in?
No; the hurt that had been caused by self-indulgence must
be cured by self-denial; the flesh I had pampered must be
crucified. I looked about me for that course which I least
liked to follow: this was to leave the wood without waiting
to see Alan, and go forth again alone, in the dark and in the
midst of my perplexed and dangerous fortunes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page102"></a>102</span></p>

<p>I have been the more careful to narrate this passage of
my reflections, because I think it is of some utility, and may
serve as an example to young men. But there is reason
(they say) in planting kale, and, even in ethic and religion,
room for common sense. It was already close on Alan&rsquo;s
hour, and the moon was down. If I left (as I could not very
decently whistle to my spies to follow me) they might miss
me in the dark and tack themselves to Alan by mistake. If
I stayed, I could at the least of it set my friend upon his
guard, which might prove his mere salvation. I had adventured
other people&rsquo;s safety in a course of self-indulgence;
to have endangered them again, and now on a mere design
of penance, would have been scarce rational. Accordingly,
I had scarce risen from my place, ere I sat down again, but
already in a different frame of spirits, and equally marvelling
at my past weakness, and rejoicing in my present composure.</p>

<p>Presently after came a crackling in the thicket. Putting
my mouth near down to the ground, I whistled a note or
two of Alan&rsquo;s air; an answer came, in the like guarded tone,
and soon we had knocked together in the dark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this you at last, Davie?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just myself,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God, man, but I&rsquo;ve been wearying to see ye!&rdquo; says he.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had the longest kind of a time. A&rsquo; day I&rsquo;ve had my
dwelling into the inside of a stack of hay, where I couldna
see the nebs of my ten fingers; and then two hours of it
waiting here for you, and you never coming! Dod, and
ye&rsquo;re none too soon the way it is, with me to sail the morn!
The morn? what am I saying?&mdash;the day, I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, Alan man, the day, sure enough,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
past twelve now, surely, and ye sail the day. This&rsquo;ll be
a long road you have before you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a long crack of it first,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, indeed, and I have a good deal it will be telling
you to hear,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>And I told him what behoved, making rather a jumble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103"></a>103</span>
of it, but clear enough when done. He heard me out with
very few questions, laughing here and there like a man
delighted: and the sound of his laughing (above all there,
in the dark, where neither one of us could see the other) was
extraordinary friendly to my heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, Davie, ye&rsquo;re a queer character,&rdquo; says he, when
I had done: &ldquo;a queer bitch after a&rsquo;, and I have no mind of
meeting with the like of ye. As for your story, Prestongrange
is a Whig like yoursel&rsquo;, so I&rsquo;ll say the less of him;
and, dod! I believe he was the best friend ye had, if ye could
only trust him. But Simon Fraser and James More are my
ain kind of cattle, and I&rsquo;ll give them the name that they
deserve. The muckle black deil was father to the Frasers,
a&rsquo;body kens that; and as for the Gregara, I never could
abye the reek o&rsquo; them since I could stotter on two feet. I
bloodied the nose of one, I mind, when I was still so wambly
on my legs that I cowped upon the top of him. A proud
man was my father that day, God rest him! and I think he
had the cause. I&rsquo;ll never can deny but what Robin was
something of a piper,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;but as for James More,
the deil guide him for me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One thing we have to consider,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Was
Charles Stewart right or wrong? Is it only me they&rsquo;re after,
or the pair of us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s your ain opinion, you that&rsquo;s a man of so
much experience?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It passes me,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And me too,&rdquo; says Alan. &ldquo;Do ye think this lass
would keep her word to ye?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do that,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s nae telling,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And anyway,
that&rsquo;s over and done: he&rsquo;ll be joined to the rest of them
lang syne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many would ye think there would be of them?&rdquo;
I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; said Alan. &ldquo;If it was only you, they
would likely send two-three lively, brisk young birkies, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104"></a>104</span>
if they thought that I was to appear in the employ, I daresay
ten or twelve,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>It was no use, I gave a little crack of laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I think your own two eyes will have seen me drive
that number, or the double of it, nearer hand!&rdquo; cries he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It matters the less,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;because I am well rid of
them for this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nae doubt that&rsquo;s your opinion,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but I
wouldna be the least surprised if they were hunkering this
wood. Ye see, David man, they&rsquo;ll be Hieland folk. There&rsquo;ll
be some Frasers, I&rsquo;m thinking, and some of the Gregara;
and I would never deny but what the both of them, and the
Gregara in especial, were clever experienced persons. A
man kens little till he&rsquo;s driven a spreagh of neat cattle (say)
ten miles through a throng lowland country and the black
soldiers maybe at his tail. It&rsquo;s there that I learned a great
part of my penetration. And ye needna tell me: it&rsquo;s better
than war; which is the next best, however, though generally
rather a bauchle of a business. Now the Gregara have had
grand practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt that&rsquo;s a branch of education that was left
out with me,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I can see the marks of it upon ye constantly,&rdquo;
said Alan. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s the strange thing about you folk
of the college learning: ye&rsquo;re ignorant, and ye canna see&rsquo;t.
Wae&rsquo;s me for my Greek and Hebrew; but, man, I ken that
I dinna ken them&mdash;there&rsquo;s the differ of it. Now, here&rsquo;s you.
Ye lie on your wame a bittie in the bield of this wood, and
ye tell me that ye&rsquo;ve cuist off these Frasers and Macgregors.
Why! <i>Because I couldna see them</i>, says you. Ye blockhead,
that&rsquo;s their livelihood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take the worst of it,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and what are we to
do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am thinking of that same,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;We might
twine. It wouldna be greatly to my taste; and forbye that,
I see reasons against it. First, it&rsquo;s now unco dark, and it&rsquo;s
just humanly possible we might give them the clean slip.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"></a>105</span>
If we keep together, we make but the ae line of it; if we
gang separate, we make twae of them: the more likelihood
to stave in upon some of these gentry of yours. And then,
second, if they keep the track of us, it may come to a fecht
for it yet, Davie; and then, I&rsquo;ll confess I would be blithe
to have you at my oxter, and I think you would be none the
worse of having me at yours. So, by my way of it, we should
creep out of this wood no further gone than just the inside of
next minute, and hold away east for Gillane, where I&rsquo;m to
find my ship. It&rsquo;ll be like old days while it lasts, Davie;
and (come the time) we&rsquo;ll have to think what you should be
doing. I&rsquo;m wae to leave ye here, wanting me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have with ye, then!&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;Do ye gang back
where you were stopping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Deil a fear!&rdquo; said Alan. &ldquo;They were good folks to
me, but I think they would be a good deal disappointed if
they saw my bonny face again. For (the way times go) I
amna just what ye could call a Walcome Guest. Which
makes me the keener for your company, Mr. David Balfour
of the Shaws, and set ye up! For, leave aside twa cracks
here in the wood with Charlie Stewart, I have scarce said
black or white since the day we parted at Corstorphine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With which he rose from his place, and we began to move
quietly eastward through the wood.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>

<h5>ON THE MARCH AGAIN WITH ALAN</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">It</span> was likely between one and two; the moon (as I have
said) was down; a strongish wind, carrying a heavy wrack
of cloud, had set in suddenly from the west; and we began
our movement in as black a night as ever a fugitive or a
murderer wanted. The whiteness of the path guided us
into the sleeping town of Broughton, thence through Picardy,
and beside my old acquaintance the gibbet of the two
thieves. A little beyond we made a useful beacon, which
was a light in an upper window of Lochend. Steering by
this, but a good deal at random, and with some trampling
of the harvest, and stumbling and falling down upon the
bauks, we made our way across country, and won forth at
last upon the linky, boggy muirland that they call the
Figgate Whins. Here, under a bush of whin, we lay down
the remainder of that night and slumbered.</p>

<p>The day called us about five. A beautiful morning it
was, the high westerly wind still blowing strong, but the
clouds all blown away to Europe. Alan was already sitting
up and smiling to himself. It was my first sight of my friend
since we were parted, and I looked upon him with enjoyment.
He had still the same big great-coat on his back;
but (what was new) he had now a pair of knitted boot-hose
drawn above the knee. Doubtless these were intended for
disguise; but, as the day promised to be warm, he made a
most unseasonable figure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Davie,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is this no&rsquo; a bonny morning?
Here is a day that looks the way that a day ought to. This
is a great change of it from the belly of my haystack; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"></a>107</span>
while you were there sottering and sleeping I have done a
thing that maybe I do over seldom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what was that?&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, just said my prayers,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where are my gentry, as ye call them?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gude kens,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;and the short and the long of
it is that we must take our chance of them. Up with your
foot-soles, Davie! Forth, Fortune, once again of it! And
a bonny walk we are like to have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So we went east by the beach of the sea, towards where
the salt-pans were smoking, in by the Esk mouth. No doubt
there was a by-ordinary bonny blink of morning sun on
Arthur&rsquo;s Seat and the green Pentlands; and the pleasantness
of the day appeared to set Alan among nettles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel like a gomeril,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;to be leaving Scotland
on a day like this. It sticks in my head; I would maybe
like it better to stay here and hing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, but ye wouldna, Alan,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&rsquo; but what France is a good place too,&rdquo; he explained;
&ldquo;but it&rsquo;s some way no&rsquo; the same. It&rsquo;s brawer, I
believe, but it&rsquo;s no&rsquo; Scotland. I like it fine when I&rsquo;m there,
man; yet I kind of weary for Scots divots and the Scots
peat-reek.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s all you have to complain of, Alan, it&rsquo;s no such
great affair,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it sets me ill to be complaining, whatever,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;and me but new out of yon deil&rsquo;s haystack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so you were unco weary of your haystack?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weary&rsquo;s nae word for it,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not just
precisely a man that&rsquo;s easily cast down; but I do better with
caller air and the lift above my head. I&rsquo;m like the auld
Black Douglas (wasna&rsquo;t?) that likit better to hear the
laverock sing than the mouse cheep. And yon place, ye
see, Davie&mdash;whilk was a very suitable place to hide in, as
I&rsquo;m free to own&mdash;was pit mirk from dawn to gloaming.
There were days (or nights, for how would I tell one from
other?) that seemed to me as long as a long winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"></a>108</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you know the hour to bide your tryst?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The goodman brought me my meat and a drop brandy,
and a candle-dowp to eat it by, about eleeven,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;So, when I had swallowed a bit, it would be time to be
getting to the wood. There I lay and wearied for ye sore,
Davie,&rdquo; says he, laying his hand on my shoulder, &ldquo;and
guessed when the two hours would be about by&mdash;unless
Charlie Stewart would come and tell me on his watch&mdash;and
then back to the dooms haystack. Na, it was a driech
employ, and praise the Lord that I have warstled through
with it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you do with yourself?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faith,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the best I could! Whiles I played
at the knucklebones. I&rsquo;m an extraordinar good hand at
the knucklebones, but it&rsquo;s a poor piece of business playing
with naebody to admire ye. And whiles I would make
songs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were they about?&rdquo; says I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, about the deer and the heather,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and
about the ancient old chiefs that are all by with it lang syne,
and just about what songs are about in general. And then
whiles I would make believe I had a set of pipes and I was
playing. I played some grand springs, and I thought I
played them awful bonny; I vow whiles that I could hear
the squeal of them! But the great affair is that it&rsquo;s done
with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that he carried me again to my adventures, which
he heard all over again with more particularity, and extraordinary
approval, swearing at intervals that I was &ldquo;a
queer character of a callant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So ye were frich&rsquo;ened of Sim Fraser?&rdquo; he asked once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In troth was I!&rdquo; cried I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So would I have been, Davie,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And that
is indeed a dreidful man. But it is only proper to give the
deil his due; and I can tell you he is a most respectable
person on the field of war.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page109"></a>109</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he so brave?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brave!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;He is as brave as my steel sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The story of my duel set him beside himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To think of that!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I showed ye the trick
in Corrynakiegh too. And three times&mdash;three times disarmed!
It&rsquo;s a disgrace upon my character that learned ye!
Here, stand up, out with your airn; ye shall walk no step
beyond this place upon the road till ye can do yoursel&rsquo; and
me mair credit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alan,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;this is midsummer madness. Here
is no time for fencing lessons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I canna well say no to that,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;But
three times, man! And you standing there like a straw
bogle and rinning to fetch your ain sword like a doggie with
a pocket-napkin! David, this man Duncansby must be
something altogether by-ordinar! He maun be extraordinar
skilly. If I had the time, I would gang straight back and
try a turn at him mysel&rsquo;. The man must be a provost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You silly fellow,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you forget it was just
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Na,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but three times!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When ye ken yourself that I am fair incompetent,&rdquo; I
cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I never heard tell the equal of it,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise you the one thing, Alan,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;The
next time that we forgather, I&rsquo;ll be better learned. You
shall not continue to bear the disgrace of a friend that
cannot strike.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, the next time!&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;And when will that
be, I would like to ken?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Alan, I have had some thoughts of that, too,&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;and my plan is this. It&rsquo;s my opinion to be called
an advocate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s but a weary trade, Davie,&rdquo; says Alan, &ldquo;and
rather a blagyard one forbye. Ye would be better in a
king&rsquo;s coat than that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And no doubt that would be the way to have us meet,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110"></a>110</span>
cried I. &ldquo;But as you&rsquo;ll be in King Lewie&rsquo;s coat, and I&rsquo;ll
be in King Geordie&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;ll have a dainty meeting of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some sense in that,&rdquo; he admitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An advocate, then, it&rsquo;ll have to be,&rdquo; I continued,
&ldquo;and I think it a more suitable trade for a gentleman that
was <i>three times</i> disarmed. But the beauty of the thing is
this: that one of the best colleges for that kind of learning&mdash;and
the one where my kinsman, Pilrig, made his studies&mdash;is
the college of Leyden in Holland. Now, what say you,
Alan? Could not a cadet of <i>Royal Ecossais</i> get a furlough,
slip over the marches, and call in upon a Leyden student!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and I would think he could!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;Ye
see, I stand well in with my colonel, Count Drummond-Melfort;
and, what&rsquo;s mair to the purpose, I have a cousin
of mine lieutenant-colonel in a regiment of the Scots-Dutch.
Naething could be mair proper than what I would get a
leave to see Lieutenant-Colonel Stewart of Halkett&rsquo;s. And
Lord Melfort, who is a very scienteefic kind of a man, and
writes books like Cæsar, would be doubtless very pleased
to have the advantage of my observes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Lord Melfort an author, then?&rdquo; I asked; for much
as Alan thought of soldiers, I thought more of the gentry
that write books.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very same, Davie,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;One would think
a colonel would have something better to attend to. But
what can I say that make songs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it only remains you should give
me an address to write you at in France; and as soon as I
am got to Leyden I will send you mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The best will be to write me in the care of my chieftain,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;Charles Stewart, of Ardshiel, Esquire, at the town
of Melons, in the Isle of France. It might take long, or it
might take short, but it would aye get to my hands at the last
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had a haddock to our breakfast in Musselburgh,
where it amused me vastly to hear Alan. His great-coat and
boot-hose were extremely remarkable this warm morning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111"></a>111</span>
and perhaps some hint of an explanation had been wise; but
Alan went into that matter like a business, or, I should
rather say, like a diversion. He engaged the goodwife of
the house with some compliments upon the rizzoring of our
haddocks; and the whole of the rest of our stay held her in
talk about a cold he had taken on his stomach, gravely
relating all manner of symptoms and sufferings, and hearing
with a vast show of interest all the old wives&rsquo; remedies she
could supply him with in return.</p>

<p>We left Musselburgh before the first ninepenny coach
was due from Edinburgh, for (as Alan said) that was a
rencounter we might very well avoid. The wind, although
still high, was very mild, the sun shone strong, and Alan
began to suffer in proportion. From Prestonpans he had
me aside to the field of Gladsmuir, where he exerted himself
a great deal more than needful to describe the stages of the
battle. Thence, at his old round pace, we travelled to
Cockenzie. Though they were building herring-busses
there at Mrs. Cadell&rsquo;s, it seemed a desert-like, back-going
town, about half full of ruined houses; but the ale-house
was clean, and Alan, who was now in a glowing heat, must
indulge himself with a bottle of ale, and carry on to the new
luckie with the old story of the cold upon his stomach, only
now the symptoms were all different.</p>

<p>I sat listening; and it came in my mind that I had
scarce ever heard him address three serious words to any
woman, but he was always drolling and fleering and making
a private mock of them, and yet brought to that business a
remarkable degree of energy and interest. Something to
this effect I remarked to him, when the goodwife (as chanced)
was called away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do ye want?&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;A man should aye
put his best foot forrit with the women-kind; he should aye
give them a bit of a story to divert them, the poor lambs!
It&rsquo;s what ye should learn to attend to, David; ye should get
the principles, it&rsquo;s like a trade. Now, if this had been a
young lassie, or onyways bonny, she would never have heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112"></a>112</span>
tell of my stomach, Davie. But aince they&rsquo;re too old to be
seeking joes, they a&rsquo; set up to be apotecaries. Why? What
do I ken? They&rsquo;ll be just the way God made them, I suppose.
But I think a man would be a gomeril that didna give
his attention to the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And here, the luckie coming back, he turned from me as
if with impatience to renew their former conversation. The
lady had branched some while before from Alan&rsquo;s stomach
to the case of a good-brother of her own in Aberlady, whose
last sickness and demise she was describing at extraordinary
length. Sometimes it was merely dull, sometimes both
dull and awful, for she talked with unction. The upshot
was that I fell in a deep muse, looking forth of the window
on the road, and scarce marking what I saw. Presently,
had any been looking, they might have seen me to start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We pit a fomentation to his feet,&rdquo; the goodwife was
saying, &ldquo;and a het stane to his wame, and we gied him
hyssop and water of pennyroyal, and fine clean balsam of
sulphur for the hoast....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; says I, cutting very quietly in, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a friend
of mine gone by the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that e&rsquo;en sae?&rdquo; replies Alan, as though it were a
thing of small account. And then, &ldquo;Ye were saying, mem?&rdquo;
says he; and the wearyful wife went on.</p>

<p>Presently, however, he paid her with a half-crown piece,
and she must go forth after the change.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it him with the red head?&rdquo; asked Alan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye have it,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you in the wood?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;And
yet it&rsquo;s strange he should be here too. Was he his lane?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His lee-lane for what I could see,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he gang by?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Straight by,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and looked neither to the right
nor left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s queerer yet,&rdquo; said Alan. &ldquo;It sticks in my
mind, Davie, that we should be stirring. But where to?&mdash;deil
hae&rsquo;t! This is like old days fairly,&rdquo; cries he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page113"></a>113</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one big differ, though,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that now we
have money in our pockets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And another big differ, Mr. Balfour,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that
now we have dogs at our tail. They&rsquo;re on the scent; they&rsquo;re
in full cry, David. It&rsquo;s a bad business and be damned to it.&rdquo;
And he sat thinking hard with a look of his that I knew well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying, Luckie,&rdquo; says he, when the goodwife returned,
&ldquo;have ye a back road out of this change-house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She told him there was, and where it led to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, sir,&rdquo; says he to me, &ldquo;I think that will be the
shortest road for us. And here&rsquo;s good-bye to ye, my braw
woman; and I&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; forget thon of the cinnamon-water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We went out by way of the woman&rsquo;s kale-yard, and up
a lane among fields. Alan looked sharply to all sides, and
seeing we were in a little hollow place of the country, out of
view of men, sat down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for a council of war, Davie,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But
first of all, a bit lesson to ye. Suppose that I had been like
you, what would yon old wife have minded of the pair of
us? Just that we had gone out by the back gate. And
what does she mind now? A fine, canty, friendly, cracky
man, that suffered with the stomach, poor body! and was
rael ta&rsquo;en up about the good-brother. O man, David, try
and learn to have some kind of intelligence!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try, Alan,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now for him of the red head,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;was he
gaun fast or slow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Betwixt and between,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No kind of a hurry about the man?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never a sign of it,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nhm!&rdquo; said Alan, &ldquo;it looks queer. We saw nothing
of them this morning on the Whins; he&rsquo;s passed us by, he
doesna seem to be looking, and yet here he is on our road!
Dod, Davie, I begin to take a notion. I think it&rsquo;s no&rsquo; you
they&rsquo;re seeking, I think it&rsquo;s me; and I think they ken fine
where they&rsquo;re gaun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They ken?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page114"></a>114</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Andie Scougal&rsquo;s sold me&mdash;him, or his mate,
wha kennt some part of the affair&mdash;or else Chairlie&rsquo;s clerk
callant, which would be a pity too,&rdquo; says Alan; &ldquo;and if
you askit me for just my inward private conviction, I think
there&rsquo;ll be heads cracked on Gillane Sands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alan,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re at all right, there&rsquo;ll be folk
there and to spare. It&rsquo;ll be small service to crack heads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would aye be a satisfaction, though,&rdquo; says Alan.
&ldquo;But bide a bit, bide a bit; I&rsquo;m thinking&mdash;and thanks to
this bonny westland wind, I believe I&rsquo;ve still a chance of it.
It&rsquo;s this way, Davie. I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; trysted with this man
Scougal till the gloaming comes. &lsquo;<i>But</i>,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;<i>if I can
get a bit of a wind out of the west I&rsquo;ll be there long or that</i>,&rsquo; he
says, &lsquo;<i>and lie-to for ye behind the Isle of Fidra</i>.&rsquo; Now if your
gentry kens the place, they ken the time forbye. Do ye see
me coming, Davie? Thanks to Johnnie Cope and other red-coat
gomerils, I should ken this country like the back of my
hand; and if ye&rsquo;re ready for another bit run with Alan
Breck, we&rsquo;ll can cast back inshore, and come down to the
seaside again by Dirleton. If the ship&rsquo;s there, we&rsquo;ll try and
get on board of her. If she&rsquo;s no&rsquo; there, I&rsquo;ll just have to get
back to my weary haystack. But either way of it, I think
we will leave your gentry whistling on their thumbs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe there&rsquo;s some chance in it,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Have
on with ye, Alan!&rdquo;</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page115"></a>115</span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>

<h5>GILLANE SANDS</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">I did</span> not profit by Alan&rsquo;s pilotage as he had done by his
marchings under General Cope; for I can scarce tell what
way we went. It is my excuse that we travelled exceeding
fast. Some part we ran, some trotted, and the rest walked
at a vengeance of a pace. Twice, while we were at top
speed, we ran against country-folk; but though we plumped
into the first from round a corner, Alan was as ready as a
loaded musket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hae ye seen my horse?&rdquo; he gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Na, man, I haena seen nae horse the day,&rdquo; replied the
countryman.</p>

<p>And Alan spared the time to explain to him that we were
travelling &ldquo;ride and tie&rdquo;; that our charger had escaped,
and it was feared he had gone home to Linton. Not only
that, but he expended some breath (of which he had not very
much left) to curse his own misfortune and my stupidity,
which was said to be its cause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Them that canna tell the truth,&rdquo; he observed to myself
as we went on again, &ldquo;should be aye mindfu&rsquo; to leave an
honest, handy lee behind them. If folk dinna ken what
ye&rsquo;re doing, Davie, they&rsquo;re terrible taken up with it; but
if they think they ken, they care nae mair for it than what
I do for pease porridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As we had first made inland, so our road came in the end
to lie very near due north; the old Kirk of Aberlady for a
landmark on the left; on the right, the top of the Berwick
Law; and it was thus we struck the shore again, not far from
Dirleton. From North Berwick west to Gillane Ness there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116"></a>116</span>
runs a string of four small islets, Craigleith, the Lamb, Fidra,
and Eyebrough, notable by their diversity of size and shape.
Fidra is the most particular, being a strange grey islet of
two humps, made the more conspicuous by a piece of ruin;
and I mind that (as we drew closer to it) by some door or
window of these ruins the sea peeped through like a man&rsquo;s
eye. Under the lee of Fidra there is a good anchorage in
westerly winds, and there, from a far way off, we could see
the <i>Thistle</i> riding.</p>

<p>The shore in face of these islets is altogether waste.
Here is no dwelling of man, and scarce any passage, or at
most of vagabond children running at their play. Gillane
is a small place on the far side of the Ness, the folk of
Dirleton go to their business in the inland fields, and those
of North Berwick straight to the sea-fishing from their
haven; so that few parts of the coast are lonelier. But I
mind, as we crawled upon our bellies into that multiplicity
of heights and hollows, keeping a bright eye upon all sides,
and our hearts hammering at our ribs, there was such a
shining of the sun and the sea, such a stir of the wind in the
bent-grass, and such a bustle of down-popping rabbits and
up-flying gulls, that the desert seemed to me like a place
alive. No doubt it was in all ways well chosen for a secret
embarkation, if the secret had been kept; and even
now that it was out, and the place watched, we were
able to creep unperceived to the front of the sandhills,
where they look down immediately on the beach and
sea.</p>

<p>But here Alan came to a full stop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Davie,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is a kittle passage! As long
as we lie here we&rsquo;re safe; but I&rsquo;m nane sae muckle nearer to
my ship or the coast of France. And as soon as we stand up
and signal the brig, it&rsquo;s another matter. For where will
your gentry be, think ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;re no&rsquo; come yet,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;And even if
they are, there&rsquo;s one clear matter in our favour. They&rsquo;ll
be all arranged to take us, that&rsquo;s true. But they&rsquo;ll have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117"></a>117</span>
arranged for our coming from the east and here we are
upon their west.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; says Alan, &ldquo;I wish we were in some force, and
this was a battle, we would have bonnily outman&oelig;uvred
them! But it isna, Davit; and the way it is, is a wee thing
less inspiring to Alan Breck. I swither, Davie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time flies, Alan,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ken that,&rdquo; said Alan. &ldquo;I ken naething else, as the
French folk say. But this is a dreidful case of heids or tails.
O! if I could but ken where your gentry were!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alan,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;this is no&rsquo; like you. It&rsquo;s got to be now
or never.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center f90">&ldquo;This is no&rsquo; me, quo&rsquo; he,&rdquo;</p>

<p class="noind">sang Alan, with a queer face betwixt shame and drollery,</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;Neither you nor me, quo&rsquo; he, neither you nor me,</p>
<p class="i05">Wow, na, Johnnie man! neither you nor me.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>And then of a sudden he stood straight up where he was,
and with a handkerchief flying in his right hand, marched
down upon the beach. I stood up myself, but lingered
behind him, scanning the sandhills to the east. His appearance
was at first unremarked: Scougal not expecting him
so early, and <i>my gentry</i> watching on the other side. Then
they awoke on board the <i>Thistle</i>, and it seemed they had all
in readiness, for there was scarce a second&rsquo;s bustle on the
deck before we saw a skiff put round her stern and begin to
pull lively for the coast. Almost at the same moment of
time, and perhaps half a mile away towards Gillane Ness, the
figure of a man appeared for a blink upon a sandhill, waving
with his arms; and though he was gone again in the same
flash, the gulls in that part continued a little longer to fly
wild.</p>

<p>Alan had not seen this, looking straight to seaward at
the ship and skiff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It maun be as it will!&rdquo; said he, when I had told him.
&ldquo;Weel may yon boatie row, or my craig&rsquo;ll have to thole a
raxing.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118"></a>118</span></p>

<p>That part of the beach was long and flat, and excellent
walking when the tide was down; a little cressy burn flowed
over it in one place to the sea; and the sandhills ran along
the head of it like the rampart of a town. No eye of ours
could spy what was passing behind there in the bents, no
hurry of ours could mend the speed of the boat&rsquo;s coming:
time stood still with us through that uncanny period of
waiting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one thing I would like to ken,&rdquo; says Alan.
&ldquo;I would like fine to ken these gentry&rsquo;s orders. We&rsquo;re
worth four hunner pound the pair of us: how if they took
the guns to us, Davie? They would get a bonny shot from
the top of that lang sandy bauk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morally impossible,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;The point is that they
can have no guns. This thing has been gone about too
secret; pistols they may have, but never guns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe ye&rsquo;ll be in the right,&rdquo; says Alan. &ldquo;For all
which I am wearying a good deal for yon boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he snapped his fingers and whistled to it like a dog.</p>

<p>It was now perhaps a third of the way in, and we ourselves
already hard on the margin of the sea, so that the soft sand
rose over my shoes. There was no more to do whatever but
to wait, to look as much as we were able at the creeping
nearer of the boat, and as little as we could manage at the
long impenetrable front of the sandhills, over which the
gulls twinkled and behind which our enemies were doubtless
marshalling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a fine, bright, caller place to get shot in,&rdquo; says
Alan suddenly; &ldquo;and, man, I wish that I had your courage!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alan!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;what kind of talk is this of it?
You&rsquo;re just made of courage; it&rsquo;s the character of the man,
as I could prove myself if there was nobody else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you would be the more mistaken,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;What makes the differ with me is just my great penetration
and knowledge of affairs. But for auld, cauld, dour,
deidly courage, I am not fit to hold a candle to yourself.
Look at us two here upon the sands. Here am I, fair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119"></a>119</span>
hotching to be off; here&rsquo;s you (for all that I ken) in two
minds of it whether you&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; stop. Do you think that
I could do that, or would? No&rsquo; me! Firstly, because I
havena got the courage and wouldna daur; and secondly,
because I am a man of so much penetration and would see
ye damned first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s there ye&rsquo;re coming, is it?&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Ah, man
Alan, you can wile your old wives, but you never can wile
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Remembrance of my temptation in the wood made me
strong as iron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a tryst to keep,&rdquo; I continued. &ldquo;I am trysted
with your cousin Charlie; I have passed my word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Braw trysts that you&rsquo;ll can keep,&rdquo; said Alan. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll
just mistryst aince and for a&rsquo; with the gentry in the bents.
And what for?&rdquo; he went on with an extreme threatening
gravity. &ldquo;Just tell me that, my mannie! Are ye to be
speerited away like Lady Grange? Are they to drive a dirk
in your inside and bury ye in the bents? Or is it to be the
other way, and are they to bring ye in with James? Are
they folk to be trustit? Would ye stick your head in the
mouth of Simon Fraser and the ither Whigs?&rdquo; he added
with extraordinary bitterness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alan,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re all rogues and liars, and I&rsquo;m
with ye there. The more reason there should be one decent
man in such a land of thieves! My word is passed, and I&rsquo;ll
stick to it. I said long syne to your kinswoman that I
would stumble at no risk. Do ye mind of that?&mdash;the night
Red Colin fell, it was. No more I will, then. Here I stop.
Prestongrange promised me my life; if he&rsquo;s to be man-sworn,
here I&rsquo;ll have to die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aweel, aweel,&rdquo; said Alan.</p>

<p>All this time we had seen or heard no more of our
pursuers. In truth we had caught them unawares; their
whole party (as I was to learn afterwards) had not yet
reached the scene; what there was of them was spread
among the bents towards Gillane. It was quite an affair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120"></a>120</span>
to call them in and bring them over, and the boat was
making speed. They were, besides, but cowardly fellows;
a mere leash of Highland cattle-thieves, of several clans, no
gentleman there to be the captain: and the more they looked
at Alan and me upon the beach, the less (I must suppose)
they liked the looks of us.</p>

<p>Whoever had betrayed Alan it was not the captain:
he was in the skiff himself, steering and stirring up his oars-men,
like a man with his heart in his employ. Already he
was near in, and the boat scouring&mdash;already Alan&rsquo;s face had
flamed crimson with the excitement of his deliverance, when
our friends in the bents, either in despair to see their prey
escape them, or with some hope of scaring Andie, raised
suddenly a shrill cry of several voices.</p>

<p>This sound, arising from what appeared to be a quite
deserted coast, was really very daunting, and the men in
the boat held water instantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this of it?&rdquo; sings out the captain, for he was
come within an easy hail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Freens o&rsquo; mine,&rdquo; says Alan, and began immediately
to wade forth in the shallow water towards the boat.
&ldquo;Davie,&rdquo; he said, pausing, &ldquo;Davie, are ye no&rsquo; coming?
I am sweer to leave ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a hair of me,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>He stood part of a second where he was to his knees in
the salt water, hesitating.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He that will to Cupar, maun to Cupar,&rdquo; said he, and
swashing in deeper than his waist, was hauled into the skiff,
which was immediately directed for the ship.</p>

<p>I stood where he had left me, with my hands behind my
back; Alan sat with his head turned, watching me; and
the boat drew smoothly away. Of a sudden I came the
nearest hand to shedding tears, and seemed to myself the
most deserted, solitary lad in Scotland. With that I turned
my back upon the sea and faced the sandhills. There was
no light or sound of man; the sun shone on the wet sand
and the dry, the wind blew in the bents, the gulls made a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121"></a>121</span>
dreary piping. As I passed higher up the beach, the sand-lice
were hopping nimbly about the stranded tangles. The
devil any other sight or sound in that unchancy place. And
yet I knew there were folk there, observing me, upon some
secret purpose. They were no soldiers, or they would have
fallen on and taken us ere now: doubtless they were some
common rogues hired for my undoing, perhaps to kidnap,
perhaps to murder me outright. From the position of
those engaged, the first was the more likely; from what
I knew of their character and ardency in this business, I
thought the second very possible; and the blood ran cold
about my heart.</p>

<p>I had a mad idea to loosen my sword in the scabbard;
for though I was very unfit to stand up like a gentleman
blade to blade, I thought I could do some scathe in a random
combat. But I perceived in time the folly of resistance.
This was no doubt the joint &ldquo;expedient&rdquo; on which Prestongrange
and Fraser were agreed. The first, I was very sure,
had done something to secure my life; the second was pretty
likely to have slipped in some contrary hints into the ears
of Neil and his companions; and if I were to show bare steel
I might play straight into the hands of my worst enemy and
seal my own doom.</p>

<p>These thoughts brought me to the head of the beach.
I cast a look behind, the boat was nearing the brig, and Alan
flew his handkerchief for a farewell, which I replied to with
the waving of my hand. But Alan himself was shrunk to
a small thing in my view, alongside of this pass that lay in
front of me. I set my hat hard on my head, clenched my
teeth, and went right before me up the face of the sand-wreath.
It made a hard climb, being steep, and the sand
like water underfoot. But I caught hold at last by the long
bent-grass on the brae-top, and pulled myself to a good
footing. The same moment men stirred and stood up here
and there, six or seven of them, ragged-like knaves, each
with a dagger in his hand. The fair truth is, I shut my eyes
and prayed. When I opened them again, the rogues were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122"></a>122</span>
crept the least thing nearer without speech or hurry. Every
eye was upon mine, which struck me with a strange sensation
of their brightness, and of the fear with which they continued
to approach me. I held out my hands empty: whereupon
one asked, with a strong Highland brogue, if I surrendered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Under protest,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if ye ken what that means,
which I misdoubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that word, they came all in upon me like a flight of
birds upon a carrion, seized me, took my sword, and all
the money from my pockets, bound me hand and foot with
some strong line, and cast me on a tussock of bent. There
they sat about their captive in a part of a circle and gazed
upon him silently like something dangerous, perhaps a lion
or a tiger on the spring. Presently this attention was relaxed.
They drew nearer together, fell to speech in the
Gaelic, and very cynically divided my property before my
eyes. It was my diversion in this time that I could watch
from my place the progress of my friend&rsquo;s escape. I saw
the boat come to the brig and be hoisted in, the sails fill,
and the ship pass out seaward behind the isles and by North
Berwick.</p>

<p>In the course of two hours or so, more and more ragged
Highlandmen kept collecting, Neil among the first, until the
party must have numbered near a score. With each new
arrival there was a fresh bout of talk, that sounded like
complaints and explanations; but I observed one thing,
none of those that came late had any share in the division
of my spoils. The last discussion was very violent and
eager, so that once I thought they would have quarrelled;
on the heels of which their company parted, the bulk of
them returning westward in a troop, and only three, Neil
and two others, remaining sentries on the prisoner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could name one who would be very ill pleased with
your day&rsquo;s work, Neil Duncanson,&rdquo; said I, when the rest
had moved away.</p>

<p>He assured me in answer I should be tenderly used, for
he knew I was &ldquo;acquent wi&rsquo; the leddy.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page123"></a>123</span></p>

<p>This was all our talk, nor did any other son of man appear
upon that portion of the coast until the sun had gone down
among the Highland mountains, and the gloaming was beginning
to grow dark. At which hour I was aware of a long,
lean, bony-like Lothian man of a very swarthy countenance,
that came towards us among the bents on a farm
horse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lads,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;hae ye a paper like this?&rdquo; and held
up one in his hand. Neil produced a second, which the new
comer studied through a pair of horn spectacles, and saying
all was right and we were the folk he was seeking, immediately
dismounted. I was then set in his place, my feet tied
under the horse&rsquo;s belly, and we set forth under the guidance
of the Lowlander. His path must have been very well
chosen, for we met but one pair&mdash;a pair of lovers&mdash;the whole
way, and these, perhaps taking us to be free-traders, fled
on our approach. We were at one time close at the foot of
Berwick Law on the south side; at another, as we passed
over some open hills, I spied the lights of a clachan and the
old tower of a church among some trees not far off, but too
far to cry for help, if I had dreamed of it. At last we came
again within sound of the sea. There was moonlight,
though not much; and by this I could see the three huge
towers and broken battlements of Tantallon, that old chief
place of the Red Douglases. The horse was picketed in the
bottom of the ditch to graze, and I was led within, and forth
into the court, and thence into a tumble-down stone hall.
Here my conductors built a brisk fire in the midst of the
pavement, for there was a chill in the night. My hands were
loosed, I was set by the wall in the inner end, and (the Lowlander
having produced provisions) I was given oatmeal
bread and a pitcher of French brandy. This done, I was
left once more alone with my three Highlandmen. They
sat close by the fire drinking and talking; the wind blew in
by the breaches, cast about the smoke and flames, and sang
in the tops of the towers; I could hear the sea under the
cliffs, and my mind being reassured as to my life, and my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124"></a>124</span>
body and spirits wearied with the day&rsquo;s employment, I
turned upon one side and slumbered.</p>

<p>I had no means of guessing at what hour I was wakened,
only the moon was down and the fire low. My feet were now
loosed, and I was carried through the ruins and down the
cliff-side by a precipitous path to where I found a fisher&rsquo;s
boat in a haven of the rocks. This I was had on board of,
and we began to put forth from the shore in a fine starlight.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>

<h5>THE BASS</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">I had</span> no thought where they were taking me; only looked
here and there for the appearance of a ship; and there ran
the while in my head a word of Ransome&rsquo;s&mdash;the <i>twenty-pounders</i>.
If I were to be exposed a second time to that
same former danger of the plantations, I judged it must
turn ill with me; there was no second Alan, and no second
shipwreck and spare yard to be expected now; and I saw
myself hoe tobacco under the whip&rsquo;s lash. The thought
chilled me; the air was sharp upon the water, the stretchers
of the boat drenched with a cold dew; and I shivered in my
place beside the steersman. This was the dark man whom
I have called hitherto the Lowlander; his name was Dale,
ordinarily called Black Andie. Feeling the thrill of my
shiver, he very kindly handed me a rough jacket full of
fish-scales, with which I was glad to cover myself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you for this kindness,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and will make
so free as to repay it with a warning. You take a high
responsibility in this affair. You are not like these ignorant,
barbarous Highlanders, but know what the law is, and the
risks of those that break it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am no&rsquo; just exactly what ye would ca&rsquo; an extremist
for the law,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;at the best of times; but in this
business I act with a good warranty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with me?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nae harm,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;nae harm ava&rsquo;. Ye&rsquo;ll hae
strong freens, I&rsquo;m thinking. Ye&rsquo;ll be richt eneuch yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There began to fall a greyness on the face of the sea;
little dabs of pink and red, like coals of slow fire, came in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126"></a>126</span>
the east; and at the same time the geese awakened, and
began crying about the top of the Bass. It is just the one
crag of rock, as everybody knows, but great enough to carve
a city from. The sea was extremely little, but there went
a hollow plowter round the base of it. With the growing
of the dawn I could see it clearer and clearer; the straight
crags painted with sea-birds&rsquo; droppings like a morning frost,
the sloping top of it green with grass, the clan of white geese
that cried about the sides, and the black, broken buildings
of the prison sitting close on the sea&rsquo;s edge.</p>

<p>At the sight the truth came in upon me in a clap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s there you&rsquo;re taking me!&rdquo; I cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just to the Bass, mannie,&rdquo; said he: &ldquo;whaur the auld
sants were afore ye, and I misdoubt if ye have come so fairly
by your preeson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But none dwells there now,&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;the place is
long a ruin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be the mair pleisand a change for the solan geese,
then,&rdquo; quoth Andie drily.</p>

<p>The day coming slowly brighter I observed on the bilge,
among the big stones with which fisherfolk ballast their
boats, several kegs and baskets, and a provision of fuel.
All these were discharged upon the crag. Andie, myself,
and my three Highlanders (I call them mine, although it
was the other way about), landed along with them. The
sun was not yet up when the boat moved away again, the
noise of the oars on the thole-pins echoing from the cliffs,
and left us in our singular reclusion.</p>

<p>Andie Dale was the Prefect (as I would jocularly call
him) of the Bass, being at once the shepherd and the gamekeeper
of that small and rich estate. He had to mind the
dozen or so of sheep that fed and fattened on the grass of
the sloping part of it, like beasts grazing the roof of a
cathedral. He had charge, besides, of the solan geese that
roosted in the crags; and from these an extraordinary income
is derived. The young are dainty eating, as much as
two shillings apiece being a common price, and paid willingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127"></a>127</span>
by epicures; even the grown birds are valuable for their oil
and feathers; and a part of the minister&rsquo;s stipend of North
Berwick is paid to this day in solan geese, which makes it
(in some folk&rsquo;s eyes) a parish to be coveted. To perform
these several businesses, as well as to protect the geese from
poachers, Andie had frequent occasion to sleep and pass
days altogether on the crag; and we found the man at home
there like a farmer in his steading. Bidding us all shoulder
some of the packages, a matter in which I made haste to
bear a hand, he led us in by a locked gate, which was the
only admission to the island, and through the ruins of the
fortress, to the governor&rsquo;s house. There we saw, by the
ashes in the chimney and a standing bed-place in one corner,
that he made his usual occupation.</p>

<p>This bed he now offered me to use, saying he supposed I
would set up to be gentry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My gentrice has nothing to do with where I lie,&rdquo; said
I. &ldquo;I bless God I have lain hard ere now, and can do the
same again with thankfulness. While I am here, Mr.
Andie, if that be your name, I will do my part and take my
place beside the rest of you; and I ask you on the other hand
to spare me your mockery, which I own I like ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He grumbled a little at this speech, but seemed upon
reflection to approve it. Indeed, he was a long-headed,
sensible man, and a good Whig and Presbyterian; read daily
in a pocket Bible, and was both able and eager to converse
seriously on religion, leaning more than a little towards the
Cameronian extremes. His morals were of a more doubtful
colour. I found he was deep in the free trade, and used the
ruins of Tantallon for a magazine of smuggled merchandise.
As for a gauger, I do not believe he valued the life of one at
half a farthing. But that part of the coast of Lothian is
to this day as wild a place, and the commons there as rough
a crew, as any in Scotland.</p>

<p>One incident of my imprisonment is made memorable
by a consequence it had long after. There was a warship
at this time stationed in the Firth, the <i>Seahorse</i>, Captain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128"></a>128</span>
Palliser. It chanced she was cruising in the month of
September, plying between Fife and Lothian, and sounding
for sunk dangers. Early one fine morning she was seen
about two miles to east of us, where she lowered a boat, and
seemed to examine the Wildfire Rocks and Satan&rsquo;s Bush,
famous dangers of that coast. And presently, after having
got her boat again, she came before the wind and was headed
directly for the Bass. This was very troublesome to Andie
and the Highlanders; the whole business of my sequestration
was designed for privacy, and here, with a navy captain
perhaps blundering ashore, it looked to become public
enough, if it were nothing worse. I was in a minority of
one, I am no Alan to fall upon so many, and I was far from
sure that a warship was the least likely to improve my condition.
All which considered, I gave Andie my parole of
good behaviour and obedience, and was had briskly to the
summit of the rock, where we all lay down, at the cliff&rsquo;s edge,
in different places of observation and concealment. The
<i>Seahorse</i> came straight on till I thought she would have
struck, and we (looking giddily down) could see the ship&rsquo;s
company at their quarters and hear the leadsman singing
at the lead. Then she suddenly wore and let fly a volley of
I know not how many great guns. The rock was shaken
with the thunder of the sound, the smoke flowed over our
heads, and the geese rose in number beyond computation
or belief. To hear their screaming and to see the twinkling
of their wings, made a most inimitable curiosity; and I
suppose it was after this somewhat childish pleasure that
Captain Palliser had come so near the Bass. He was to pay
dear for it in time. During his approach I had the opportunity
to make a remark upon the rigging of that ship by
which I ever after knew it miles away; and this was a means
(under Providence) of my averting from a friend a great
calamity, and inflicting on Captain Palliser himself a sensible
disappointment.</p>

<p>All the time of my stay on the rock we lived well. We
had small ale and brandy, and oatmeal of which we made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129"></a>129</span>
our porridge night and morning. At times a boat came
from the Castleton and brought us a quarter of mutton, for
the sheep upon the rock we must not touch, these being
specially fed to market. The geese were unfortunately out
of season, and we let them be. We fished ourselves, and
yet more often made the geese to fish for us: observing one
when he had made a capture and scaring him from his prey
ere he had swallowed it.</p>

<p>The strange nature of this place, and the curiosities with
which it abounded, held me busy and amused. Escape
being impossible, I was allowed my entire liberty, and continually
explored the surface of the isle wherever it might
support the foot of man. The old garden of the prison was
still to be observed, with flowers and pot-herbs running wild,
and some ripe cherries on a bush. A little lower stood a
chapel or a hermit&rsquo;s cell; who built or dwelt in it, none
may know, and the thought of its age made a ground of
many meditations. The prison, too, where I now bivouacked
with Highland cattle-thieves, was a place full of history,
both human and divine. I thought it strange so many
saints and martyrs should have gone by there so recently,
and left not so much as a leaf out of their Bibles, or a name
carved upon the wall, while the rough soldier-lads that
mounted guard upon the battlements had filled the neighbourhood
with their mementoes&mdash;broken tobacco-pipes
for the most part, and that in a surprising plenty, but also
metal buttons from their coats. There were times when I
thought I could have heard the pious sound of psalms out
of the martyrs&rsquo; dungeons, and see the soldiers tramp the
ramparts with their glinting pipes, and the dawn rising
behind them out of the North Sea.</p>

<p>No doubt it was a good deal Andie and his tales that put
these fancies in my head. He was extraordinary well
acquainted with the story of the rock in all particulars,
down to the names of private soldiers, his father having
served there in that same capacity. He was gifted, besides,
with a natural genius for narration, so that the people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130"></a>130</span>
seemed to speak and the things to be done before your face.
This gift of his, and my assiduity to listen, brought us the
more close together. I could not honestly deny but what
I liked him; I soon saw that he liked me; and indeed, from
the first I had set myself out to capture his goodwill. An
odd circumstance (to be told presently) effected this beyond
my expectation; but even in early days we made a friendly
pair to be a prisoner and his gaoler.</p>

<p>I should trifle with my conscience if I pretended my stay
upon the Bass was wholly disagreeable. It seemed to me
a safe place, as though I was escaped there out of my
troubles. No harm was to be offered me; a material impossibility,
rock and the deep sea, prevented me from fresh
attempts; I felt I had my life safe and my honour safe, and
there were times when I allowed myself to gloat on them
like stolen waters. At other times my thoughts were very
different. I recalled how strong I had expressed myself
both to Rankeillor and to Stewart; I reflected that my
captivity upon the Bass, in view of a great part of the coasts
of Fife and Lothian, was a thing I should be thought more
likely to have invented than endured; and in the eyes of
these two gentlemen, at least, I must pass for a boaster and
a coward. Now I would take this lightly enough; tell
myself that so long as I stood well with Catriona Drummond,
the opinion of the rest of man was but moonshine and spilled
water; and thence pass off into those meditations of a
lover which are so delightful to himself and must always
appear so surprisingly idle to a reader. But anon the fear
would take me otherwise; I would be shaken with a perfect
panic of self-esteem, and these supposed hard judgments
appear an injustice impossible to be supported. With that
another train of thought would be presented, and I had
scarce begun to be concerned about men&rsquo;s judgments of
myself, than I was haunted with the remembrance of James
Stewart in his dungeon and the lamentations of his wife.
Then, indeed, passion began to work in me; I could not
forgive myself to sit there idle; it seemed (if I were a man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131"></a>131</span>
at all) that I could fly or swim out of my place of safety;
and it was in such humours and to amuse my self-reproaches,
that I would set the more particularly to win the good side
of Andie Dale.</p>

<p>At last, when we two were alone on the summit of the
rock on a bright morning, I put in some hint about a bribe.
He looked at me, cast back his head, and laughed out loud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, you&rsquo;re funny, Mr. Dale,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but perhaps if
you&rsquo;ll glance an eye upon that paper you may change your
note.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stupid Highlanders had taken from me at the time
of my seizure nothing but hard money, and the paper I now
showed Andie was an acknowledgment from the British
Linen Company for a considerable sum.</p>

<p>He read it. &ldquo;Troth, and ye&rsquo;re nane sae ill aff,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought that would maybe vary your opinions,&rdquo;
said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hout!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It shows me ye can bribe; but
I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; to be bribit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that yet a while,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;And first,
I&rsquo;ll show you that I know what I am talking. You have
orders to detain me here till after Thursday, 21st
September.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re no&rsquo; a&rsquo;thegether wrong either,&rdquo; says Andie.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m to let ye gang, bar orders contrair, on Saturday,
the 23rd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could not but feel there was something extremely
insidious in this arrangement. That I was to reappear
precisely in time to be too late would cast the more discredit
on my tale, if I were minded to tell one; and this screwed
me to fighting point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now then, Andie, you that kens the world, listen to
me, and think while ye listen,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I know there are
great folks in the business, and I make no doubt you have
their names to go upon. I have seen some of them myself
since this affair began, and said my say into their faces too.
But what kind of a crime would this be that I had committed?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132"></a>132</span>
or what kind of a process is this that I am fallen
under? To be apprehended by some ragged John-Hielandmen
on August 30th, carried to a rickle of old stones that is
now neither fort nor gaol (whatever it once was) but just
the gamekeeper&rsquo;s lodge of the Bass Rock, and set free again,
September 23rd, as secretly as I was first arrested&mdash;does
that sound like law to you? or does it sound like justice?
or does it not sound honestly like a piece of some low, dirty
intrigue, of which the very folk that meddle with it are
ashamed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I canna gainsay ye, Shaws. It looks unco under-hand,&rdquo;
says Andie. &ldquo;And werena the folk guid sound
Whigs and true-blue Presbyterians I would hae seen them
ayont Jordan and Jeroozlem or I would have set hand to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Master of Lovat&rsquo;ll be a braw Whig,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;and
a grand Presbyterian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ken naething by him,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I hae nae trokings
wi&rsquo; Lovats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;ll be Prestongrange that you&rsquo;ll be dealing with,&rdquo;
said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but I&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; tell ye that,&rdquo; said Andie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little need when I ken,&rdquo; was my retort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s just the ae thing ye can be fairly sure of,
Shaws,&rdquo; says Andie. &ldquo;And that is that (try as ye please) I&rsquo;m
no&rsquo; dealing wi&rsquo; yoursel&rsquo;; nor yet I amna goin&rsquo; to,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Andie, I see I&rsquo;ll have to speak out plain with
you,&rdquo; I replied. And I told him so much as I thought
needful of the facts.</p>

<p>He heard me out with serious interest, and when I had
done, seemed to consider a little with himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shaws,&rdquo; said he at last, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll deal with the naked
hand. It&rsquo;s a queer tale, and no&rsquo; very creditable, the way
you tell it; and I&rsquo;m far frae minting that is other than the
way that ye believe it. As for yoursel&rsquo;, ye seem to me
rather a dacent-like young man. But me, that&rsquo;s aulder
and mair judeecious, see perhaps a wee bit further forrit in
the job than what ye can dae. And here is the maitter clear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133"></a>133</span>
and plain to ye. There&rsquo;ll be nae skaith to yoursel&rsquo; if I keep
ye here; far frae that, I think ye&rsquo;ll be a hantle better by it.
There&rsquo;ll be nae skaith to the kintry&mdash;just ae mair Hielantman
hangit&mdash;Gude kens, a guid riddance! On the ither
hand, it would be considerable skaith to me if I would let
you free. Sae, speakin&rsquo; as a guid Whig, an honest freen&rsquo;
to you, and an anxious freen&rsquo; to my ainsel&rsquo;, the plain fact
is that I think ye&rsquo;ll just have to bide here wi&rsquo; Andie an&rsquo; the
solans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andie,&rdquo; said I, laying my hand upon his knee, &ldquo;this
Hielantman&rsquo;s innocent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, it&rsquo;s a peety about that,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But ye see,
in this warld, the way God made it, we canna just get
a&rsquo;thing that we want.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>

<h5>BLACK ANDIE&rsquo;S TALE OF TOD LAPRAIK</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">I have</span> yet said little of the Highlanders. They were all
three of the followers of James More, which bound the
accusation very tight about their master&rsquo;s neck. All understood
a word or two of English; but Neil was the only one
who judged he had enough of it for general converse, in
which (when once he got embarked) his company was often
tempted to the contrary opinion. They were tractable,
simple creatures; showed much more courtesy than might
have been expected from their raggedness and their uncouth
appearance, and fell spontaneously to be like three servants
for Andie and myself.</p>

<p>Dwelling in that isolated place, in the old falling ruins
of a prison, and among endless strange sounds of the sea
and the sea-birds, I thought I perceived in them early the
effects of superstitious fear. When there was nothing
doing they would either lie and sleep, for which their appetite
appeared insatiable, or Neil would entertain the others
with stories which seemed always of a terrifying strain.
If neither of these delights were within reach&mdash;if perhaps
two were sleeping and the third could find no means to
follow their example&mdash;I would see him sit and listen and
look about him in a progression of uneasiness, starting, his
face blenching, his hands clutched, a man strung like a bow.
The nature of these fears I had never an occasion to find out,
but the sight of them was catching, and the nature of the
place that we were in favourable to alarms. I can find no
word for it in the English, but Andie had an expression for
it in the Scots from which he never varied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page135"></a>135</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;<i>it&rsquo;s an unco place, the
Bass</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is so I always think of it. It was an unco place by
night, unco by day; and these were unco sounds, of the
calling of the solans, and the plash of the sea and the rock
echoes, that hung continually in our ears. It was chiefly
so in moderate weather. When the waves were any way
great they roared about the rock like thunder and the
drums of armies, dreadful but merry to hear; and it was
in the calm days that a man could daunt himself with
listening&mdash;not a Highlandman only, as I several times
experimented on myself, so many still, hollow noises haunted
and reverberated in the porches of the rock.</p>

<p>This brings me to a story I heard, and a scene I took
part in, which quite changed our terms of living, and had
a great effect on my departure. It chanced one night I fell
in a muse beside the fire and (that little air of Alan&rsquo;s coming
back to my memory) began to whistle. A hand was laid
upon my arm, and the voice of Neil bade me to stop, for it
was not &ldquo;canny musics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not canny?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;How can that be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Na,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it will be made by a bogle and her
wanting ta heid upon his body.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_13" href="#Footnote_13"><span class="sp">13</span></a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there can be no bogles here, Neil;
for it&rsquo;s not likely they would fash themselves to frighten
solan geese.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay?&rdquo; says Andie, &ldquo;is that what ye think of it? But
I&rsquo;ll can tell ye there&rsquo;s been waur nor bogles here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s waur than bogles, Andie?&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Warlocks,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Or a warlock at the least of
it. And that&rsquo;s a queer tale, too,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;And if ye
would like, I&rsquo;ll tell it ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To be sure we were all of the one mind, and even the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136"></a>136</span>
Highlander that had the least English of the three set himself
to listen with all his might.</p>

<div class="pt2">&nbsp;</div>
<h5>THE TALE OF TOD LAPRAIK</h5>

<p>My faither, Tam Dale, peace to his banes, was a wild
sploring lad in his young days, wi&rsquo; little wisdom and less
grace. He was fond of a lass and fond of a glass, and fond
of a ran-dan; but I could never hear tell that he was muckle
use for honest employment. Frae ae thing to anither, he
listed at last for a sodger, and was in the garrison of this
fort, which was the first way that ony of the Dales cam to
set foot upon the Bass. Sorrow upon that service! The
governor brewed his ain ale; it seems it was the warst conceivable.
The rock was proveesioned frae the shore with
vivers, the thing was ill-guided, and there were whiles when
they büt to fish and shoot solans for their diet. To crown
a&rsquo;, thir was the Days of the Persecution. The perishin&rsquo;
cauld chalmers were a&rsquo; occupeed wi&rsquo; sants and martyrs, the
saut of the yerd, of which it wasna worthy. And though
Tam Dale carried a firelock there, a single sodger, and likit
a lass and a glass, as I was sayin&rsquo;, the mind of the man was
mair just than set with his position. He had glints of the
glory of the kirk; there were whiles when his dander rase
to see the Lord&rsquo;s sants misguided, and shame covered him
that he should be hauldin&rsquo; a can&rsquo;le (or carrying a firelock)
in so black a business. There were nights of it when he
was here on sentry, the place a&rsquo; wheesht, the frosts o&rsquo; winter
maybe riving in the wa&rsquo;s, and he would hear ane o&rsquo; the
prisoners strike up a psalm, and the rest join in, and
the blessed sounds rising from the different chalmers&mdash;or
dungeons, I would raither say&mdash;so that this auld
craig in the sea was like a pairt of Heev&rsquo;n. Black shame
was on his saul; his sins hove up before him muckle
as the Bass, and above a&rsquo;, that chief sin, that he should
have a hand in hagging and hashing at Christ&rsquo;s Kirk.
But the truth is that he resisted the spirit. Day cam,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137"></a>137</span>
there were the rousing compainions, and his guid resolves
depairtit.</p>

<p>In thir days, dwalled upon the Bass a man of God, Peden
the Prophet was his name. Ye&rsquo;ll have heard tell of Prophet
Peden. There was never the wale of him sinsyne, and it&rsquo;s
a question wi&rsquo; mony if there ever was his like afore. He was
wild&rsquo;s a peat-hag, fearsome to look at, fearsome to hear, his
face like the day of judgment. The voice of him was like
a solan&rsquo;s and dinnled in folk&rsquo;s lugs, and the words of him
like coals of fire.</p>

<p>Now there was a lass on the rock, and I think she had
little to do, for it was nae place for dacent weemen; but it
seems she was bonny, and her and Tam Dale were very well
agreed. It befell that Peden was in the gairden his lane at
the praying when Tam and the lass cam by; and what
should the lassie do but mock with laughter at the sant&rsquo;s
devotions? He rose and lookit at the twa o&rsquo; them, and
Tam&rsquo;s knees knoitered thegether at the look of him. But
whan he spak, it was mair in sorrow than in anger. &ldquo;Poor
thing, poor thing!&rdquo; says he, and it was the lass he lookit
at, &ldquo;I hear you skirl and laugh,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but the Lord
has a deid shot prepared for you, and at that surprising
judgment ye shall skirl but the ae time!&rdquo; Shortly thereafter
she was daundering on the craigs wi&rsquo; twa-three sodgers,
and it was a blawy day. There cam a gowst of wind,
claught her by the coats, and awa&rsquo; wi&rsquo; her, bag and baggage.
And it was remarkit by the sodgers that she gied but the ae
skirl.</p>

<p>Nae doubt this judgment had some weicht upon Tam
Dale; but it passed again, and him nane the better. Ae
day he was flyting wi&rsquo; anither sodger-lad. &ldquo;Deil hae me!&rdquo;
quo&rsquo; Tam, for he was a profane swearer. And there was
Peden glowering at him, gash an&rsquo; waefu&rsquo;; Peden wi&rsquo; his
lang chafts an&rsquo; luntin&rsquo; een, the maud happit about his kist,
and the hand of him held out wi&rsquo; the black nails upon the
finger-nebs&mdash;for he had nae care of the body. &ldquo;Fy, fy,
poor man!&rdquo; cries he, &ldquo;the poor fool man! <i>Deil hae me</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138"></a>138</span>
quo&rsquo; he; an&rsquo; I see the deil at his oxter.&rdquo; The conviction of
guilt and grace cam in on Tam like the deep sea; he flang
doun the pike that was in his hands&mdash;&ldquo;I will nae mair lift
arms against the cause o&rsquo; Christ!&rdquo; says he, and was as gude&rsquo;s
word. There was a sair fyke in the beginning, but the
governor, seeing him resolved, gied him his dischairge, and
he went and dwallt and merried in North Berwick, and had
aye a gude name with honest folk frae that day on.</p>

<p>It was in the year seeventeen hunner and sax that the
Bass cam in the hands o&rsquo; the Da&rsquo;rymples, and there was
twa men soucht the chairge of it. Baith were weel qualified,
for they had baith been sodgers in the garrison, and kennt
the gate to handle solans, and the seasons and values of
them. Forbye that they were baith&mdash;or they baith seemed&mdash;earnest
professors and men of comely conversation. The
first of them was just Tam Dale, my faither. The second
was ane Lapraik, whom the folk ca&rsquo;d Tod Lapraik maistly,
but whether for his name or his nature I could never hear
tell. Weel, Tam gaed to see Lapraik upon this business,
and took me, that was a toddlin&rsquo; laddie, by the hand. Tod
had his dwallin&rsquo; in the lang loan benorth the kirkyaird.
It&rsquo;s a dark, uncanny loan, forbye that the kirk has aye had
an ill name since the days o&rsquo; James the Saxt and the deevil&rsquo;s
cantrips played therein when the Queen was on the seas;
and as for Tod&rsquo;s house, it was in the mirkest end, and was
little likit by some that kenned the best. The door was on
the sneck that day, and me and my faither gaed straucht in.
Tod was a wabster to his trade; his loom stood in the but.
There he sat, a muckle fat, white hash of a man like creish,
wi&rsquo; a kind of a holy smile that gart me scunner. The hand
of him aye cawed the shuttle, but his een was steekit. We
cried to him by his name, we skirled in the deid lug of him,
we shook him by the shouther. Nae mainner o&rsquo; service!
There he sat on his dowp, an&rsquo; cawed the shuttle and smiled
like creish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God be guid to us,&rdquo; says Tam Dale, &ldquo;this is no&rsquo;
canny!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page139"></a>139</span></p>

<p>He had jimp said the word, when Tod Lapraik cam to
himsel&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this you, Tam?&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Haith, man! I&rsquo;m
blithe to see ye. I whiles fa&rsquo; into a bit dwam like this,&rdquo; he
says; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s frae the stamach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Weel, they began to crack about the Bass, and which
of them twa was to get the warding o&rsquo;t, and by little and
little cam to very ill words, and twined in anger. I mind
weel, that as my faither and me gaed hame again, he came
ower and ower the same expression, how little he likit Tod
Lapraik and his dwams.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dwam!&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;I think folk hae brunt for dwams
like yon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aweel, my faither got the Bass, and Tod had to go
wantin&rsquo;. It was remembered sinsyne what way he had
ta&rsquo;en the thing. &ldquo;Tam,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;ye hae gotten the
better o&rsquo; me aince mair, and I hope,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;ye&rsquo;ll find
at least a&rsquo; that ye expeckit at the Bass.&rdquo; Which have
since been thought remarkable expressions. At last the
time came for Tam Dale to take young solans. This was
a business he was weel used wi&rsquo;, he had been a craigsman
frae a laddie, and trustit nane but himsel&rsquo;. So there was
he, hingin&rsquo; by a line an&rsquo; speldering on the craig face, whaur
it&rsquo;s hieest and steighest. Fower tenty lads were on the tap,
hauldin&rsquo; the line and mindin&rsquo; for his signals. But whaur
Tam hung there was naething but the craig, and the sea
below, and the solans skirling and flying. It was a braw
spring morn, and Tam whustled as he claught in the young
geese. Mony&rsquo;s the time I heard him tell of this experience,
and aye the swat ran upon the man.</p>

<p>It chanced, ye see, that Tam keekit up, and he
was awaur of a muckle solan, and the solan pyking
at the line. He thocht this by-ordinar and outside
the creature&rsquo;s habits. He minded that ropes was unco
saft things, and the solan&rsquo;s neb and the Bass Rock
unco hard, and that twa hunner feet were raither mair
than he would care to fa&rsquo;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page140"></a>140</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Shoo!&rdquo; says Tam. &ldquo;Awa&rsquo;, bird! Shoo, awa&rsquo; wi&rsquo;
ye!&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p>The solan keekit doun into Tam&rsquo;s face, and there was
something unco in the creature&rsquo;s ee. Just the ae keek it
gied, and back to the rope. But now it wroucht and
warstl&rsquo;t like a thing dementit. There never was the solan
made that wroucht as that solan wroucht; and it seemed
to understand its employ brawly, birzing the saft rope between
the neb of it and a crunkled jag o&rsquo; stane.</p>

<p>There gaed a cauld stend o&rsquo; fear into Tam&rsquo;s heart.
&ldquo;This thing is nae bird,&rdquo; thinks he. His een turnt backward
in his heid and the day gaed black about him. &ldquo;If I
get a dwam here,&rdquo; he thocht, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s by wi&rsquo; Tam Dale.&rdquo;
And he signalled for the lads to pu&rsquo; him up.</p>

<p>And it seemed the solan understood about signals. For
nae sooner was the signal made than he let be the rope,
spried his wings, squawked out loud, took a turn flying,
and dashed straucht at Tam Dale&rsquo;s een. Tam had a knife,
he gart the cauld steel glitter. And it seemed the solan
understood about knives, for nae suner did the steel glint
in the sun than he gied the ae squawk, but laigher, like a
body disappointit, and flegged aff about the roundness of
the craig, and Tam saw him nae mair. And as sune as that
thing was gane, Tam&rsquo;s held drapt upon his shouther, and
they pu&rsquo;d him up like a deid corp, dadding on the craig.</p>

<p>A dram of brandy (which he went never without)
broucht him to his mind, or what was left of it. Up he sat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rin, Geordie, rin to the boat, mak&rsquo; sure of the boat,
man&mdash;rin!&rdquo; he cries, &ldquo;or yon solan&rsquo;ll have it awa&rsquo;,&rdquo; says
he.</p>

<p>The fower lads stared at ither, an&rsquo; tried to whillywha
him to be quiet. But naething would satisfy Tam Dale,
till ane o&rsquo; them had startit on aheid to stand sentry on the
boat. The ithers askit if he was for down again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Na,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and neither you nor me,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;and as sune as I can win to stand on my twa feet we&rsquo;ll
be aff frae this craig o&rsquo; Sawtan.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page141"></a>141</span></p>

<p>Sure eneuch, nae time was lost, and that was ower
muckle; for before they won to North Berwick Tam was
in a crying fever. He lay a&rsquo; the simmer; and wha was sae
kind as come speiring for him but Tod Lapraik! Folk
thocht afterwards that ilka time Tod cam near the house
the fever had worsened. I kenna for that; but what I ken
the best, that was the end of it.</p>

<p>It was about this time o&rsquo; the year; my grandfaither was
out at the white fishing; and like a bairn, I büt to gang wi&rsquo;
him. We had a grand take, I mind, and the way that the
fish lay broucht us near in by the Bass, whaur we forgathered
wi&rsquo; anither boat that belanged to a man Sandie
Fletcher in Castleton. He&rsquo;s no&rsquo; lang deid neither, or ye
could speir at himsel&rsquo;. Weel, Sandie hailed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s yon on the Bass?&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the Bass?&rdquo; says grandfaither.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; says Sandie, &ldquo;on the green side o&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatten kind of a thing?&rdquo; says grandfaither.
&ldquo;There canna be naething on the Bass but just the sheep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks unco like a body,&rdquo; quo&rsquo; Sandie, who was
nearer in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A body!&rdquo; says we, and we nane of us likit that. For
there was nae boat that could have broucht a man, and the
key o&rsquo; the prison yett hung ower my faither&rsquo;s heid at hame
in the press bed.</p>

<p>We keept the twa boats closs for company, and crap
in nearer hand. Grandfaither had a gless, for he had been
a sailor, and the captain of a smack, and had lost her on the
sands of Tay. And when we took the gless to it, sure
eneuch there was a man. He was in a crunkle o&rsquo; green
brae, a wee below the chaipel, a&rsquo; by his lee-lane, and lowped
and flang and danced like a daft quean at a waddin&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Tod,&rdquo; says grandfaither, and passed the gless to
Sandie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, it&rsquo;s him,&rdquo; says Sandie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or ane in the likeness o&rsquo; him,&rdquo; says grandfaither.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sma&rsquo; is the differ,&rdquo; quo&rsquo; Sandie. &ldquo;Deil or warlock,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142"></a>142</span>
I&rsquo;ll try the gun at him,&rdquo; quo&rsquo; he, and broucht up a fowling-piece
that he aye carried, for Sandie was a notable famous
shot in a&rsquo; that country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haud your hand, Sandie,&rdquo; says grandfaither; &ldquo;we
maun see clearer first,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;or this may be a dear day&rsquo;s
wark to the baith of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hout!&rdquo; says Sandie, &ldquo;this is the Lord&rsquo;s judgments
surely, and be damned to it!&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe ay, and maybe no,&rdquo; says my grandfaither,
worthy man! &ldquo;But have you a mind of the Procurator
Fiscal, that I think ye&rsquo;ll have forgathered wi&rsquo; before,&rdquo; says
he.</p>

<p>This was ower true, and Sandie was a wee thing set ajee.
&ldquo;Aweel, Edie,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and what would be your way
of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ou, just this,&rdquo; says grandfaither. &ldquo;Let me that has
the fastest boat gang back to North Berwick, and let you
bide here and keep an eye on Thon. If I canna find Lapraik,
I&rsquo;ll join ye, and the twa of us&rsquo;ll have a crack wi&rsquo; him.
But if Lapraik&rsquo;s at hame, I&rsquo;ll rin up the flag at the harbour,
and ye can try Thon Thing wi&rsquo; the gun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aweel, so it was agreed between them twa. I was just
a bairn, an&rsquo; clum in Sandie&rsquo;s boat, whaur I thocht I would
see the best of the employ. My grandsire gied Sandie a
siller tester to pit in his gun wi&rsquo; the leid draps, bein&rsquo; mair
deidly again bogles. And then the ae boat set aff for North
Berwick, an&rsquo; the tither lay whaur it was and watched the
wanchancy thing on the brae-side.</p>

<p>A&rsquo; the time we lay there it lowped and flang and capered
and span like a teetotum, and whiles we could hear it
skelloch as it span. I hae seen lassies, the daft queans, that
would lowp and dance a winter&rsquo;s nicht, and still be lowping
and dancing when the winter&rsquo;s day cam in. But there
would be folk there to hauld them company, and the lads
to egg them on; and this thing was its lee-lane. And there
would be a fiddler diddling his elbock in the chimney-side;
and this thing had nae music but the skirling of the solans.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143"></a>143</span>
And the lassies were bits o&rsquo; young things wi&rsquo; the reid life
dinnling and stending in their members; and this was a
muckle, fat, creishy man, and him fa&rsquo;n in the vale o&rsquo; years.
Say what ye like, I maun say what I believe. It was joy
was in the creature&rsquo;s heart; the joy o&rsquo; hell, I daursay: joy
whatever. Mony a time I have askit mysel&rsquo;, why witches
and warlocks should sell their sauls (whilk are their maist
dear possessions) and be auld, duddy, wrunkl&rsquo;t wives, or
auld, feckless, doddered men; and then I mind upon Tod
Lapraik dancing a&rsquo; thae hours by his lane in the black glory
of his heart. Nae doubt they burn for it in muckle hell,
but they have a grand time here of it, whatever!&mdash;and the
Lord forgie us!</p>

<p>Weel, at the hinder end, we saw the wee flag yirk up
to the mast-heid upon the harbour rocks. That was a&rsquo;
Sandie waited for. He up wi&rsquo; the gun, took a deleeberate
aim, an&rsquo; pu&rsquo;d the trigger. There cam a bang and then ae
waefu&rsquo; skirl frae the Bass. And there were we, rubbin&rsquo; our
een and lookin&rsquo; at ither like daft folk. For wi&rsquo; the bang
and the skirl the thing had clean disappeared. The sun
glintit, the wund blew, and there was the bare yerd whaur
the Wonder had been lowping and flinging but ae second
syne.</p>

<p>The hale way hame I roared and grat wi&rsquo; the terror of
that dispensation. The grawn folk were nane sae muckle
better; there was little said in Sandie&rsquo;s boat but just the
name of God; and when we won in by the pier, the harbour
rocks were fair black wi&rsquo; the folk waitin&rsquo; us. It seems they
had fund Lapraik in ane of his dwams, cawing the shuttle
and smiling. Ae lad they sent to hoist the flag, and the rest
abode there in the wabster&rsquo;s house. You may be sure they
likit it little; but it was a means of grace to severals that
stood there praying in to themsel&rsquo;s (for nane cared to pray
out loud) and looking on thon awesome thing as it cawed
the shuttle. Syne, upon a suddenty, and wi&rsquo; the ae dreidfu&rsquo;
skelloch, Tod sprang up frae his hinderlands and fell forrit
on the wab, a bluidy corp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page144"></a>144</span></p>

<p>When the corp was examined the leid draps hadna
played buff upon the warlock&rsquo;s body; sorrow a leid drap
was to be fund; but there was grandfaither&rsquo;s siller tester
in the puddock&rsquo;s heart of him.</p>

<div class="pt05">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Andie had scarce done when there befell a mighty silly
affair that had its consequence. Neil, as I have said, was
himself a great narrator. I have heard since that he knew
all the stories in the Highlands; and thought much of himself,
and was thought much of by others, on the strength of
it. Now Andie&rsquo;s tale reminded him of one he had already
heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She would ken that story afore,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She was
the story of Uistean More M&rsquo;Gillie Phadrig and the Gavar
Vore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is no sic a thing,&rdquo; cried Andie. &ldquo;It is the story of
my faither (now wi&rsquo; God) and Tod Lapraik. And the same
in your beard,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;and keep the tongue of ye inside
your Hielant chafts!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In dealing with Highlanders it will be found, and has
been shown in history, how well it goes with Lowland
gentlefolk; but the thing appears scarce feasible for Lowland
commons. I had already remarked that Andie was
continually on the point of quarrelling with our three Macgregors,
and now, sure enough, it was to come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thir will be no words to use to shentlemans,&rdquo; says
Neil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shentlemans!&rdquo; cries Andie. &ldquo;Shentlemans, ye
Hielant stot! If God would gie ye the grace to see yoursel&rsquo;
the way that ithers see ye, ye would throw your denner up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There came some kind of a Gaelic oath from Neil, and
the black knife was in his hand that moment.</p>

<p>There was no time to think; and I caught the Highlander
by the leg, and had him down, and his armed hand pinned
out, before I knew what I was doing. His comrades sprang
to rescue him, Andie and I were without weapons, the
Gregara three to two. It seemed we were beyond salvation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145"></a>145</span>
when Neil screamed in his own tongue, ordering the others
back, and made his submission to myself in a manner the
most abject, even giving me up his knife, which (upon a
repetition of his promises) I returned to him on the morrow.</p>

<p>Two things I saw plain: the first, that I must not build
too high on Andie, who had shrunk against the wall and stood
there, as pale as death, till the affair was over; the second,
the strength of my own position with the Highlanders, who
must have received extraordinary charges to be tender of
my safety. But if I thought Andie came not very well out
in courage, I had no fault to find with him upon the account
of gratitude. It was not so much that he troubled me with
thanks, as that his whole mind and manner appeared
changed; and as he preserved ever after a great timidity
of our companions, he and I were yet more constantly
together.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI</h3>

<h5>THE MISSING WITNESS</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">On</span> the seventeenth, the day I was trysted with the Writer,
I had much rebellion against fate. The thought of him
waiting in the &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Arms,&rdquo; and of  what he would think,
and what he would say, when next we met, tormented and
oppressed me. The truth was unbelievable, so much I had
to grant, and it seemed cruel hard I should be posted as a
liar and a coward, and have never consciously omitted what
it was possible that I should do. I repeated this form of
words with a kind of bitter relish, and re-examined in that
light the steps of my behaviour. It seemed I had behaved
to James Stewart as a brother might; all the past was a
picture that I could be proud of, and there was only the
present to consider. I could not swim the sea, nor yet fly
in the air, but there was always Andie. I had done him a
service, he liked me; I had a lever there to work on; if it
were just for decency, I must try once more with Andie.</p>

<p>It was late afternoon; there was no sound in all the
Bass but the lap and bubble of a very quiet sea; and my
four companions were all crept apart, the three Macgregors
higher on the rock, and Andie with his Bible to a sunny
place among the ruins; there I found him in deep sleep,
and, as soon as he was awake, appealed to him with some
fervour of manner and a good show of argument.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I thocht it was to do guid to ye, Shaws!&rdquo; said he,
staring at me over his spectacles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s to save another,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and to redeem my
word. What would be more good than that? Do ye no&rsquo;
mind the scripture, Andie? And you with the Book upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147"></a>147</span>
your lap! <i>What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole
world?</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s grand for you. But where do I
come in? I have my word to redeem the same&rsquo;s yoursel&rsquo;.
And what are ye asking me to do, but just to sell it ye for
siller?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andie! have I named the name of siller?&rdquo; cried I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ou, the name&rsquo;s naething,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;the thing is
there, whatever. It just comes to this: if I am to service
ye the way that you propose, I&rsquo;ll lose my lifelihood. Then
it&rsquo;s clear ye&rsquo;ll have to make it up to me, and a pickle mair,
for your ain credit like. And what&rsquo;s that but just a bribe?
And if even I was certain of the bribe! But by a&rsquo; that I
can learn, it&rsquo;s far frae that; and if <i>you</i> were to hang, where
would <i>I</i> be? Na: the thing&rsquo;s no&rsquo; possible. And just awa&rsquo;
wi&rsquo; ye like a bonny lad! and let Andie read his chapter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I remember I was at bottom a good deal gratified with
this result; and the next humour I fell into was one (I had
near said) of gratitude to Prestongrange, who had saved
me, in this violent, illegal manner, out of the midst of my
dangers, temptations, and perplexities. But this was both
too flimsy and too cowardly to last me long, and the remembrance
of James began to succeed to the possession of
my spirits. The 21st, the day set for the trial, I passed in
such misery of mind as I can scarce recall to have endured,
save perhaps upon Isle Earraid only. Much of the time I
lay on a brae-side betwixt sleep and waking, my body
motionless, my mind full of violent thoughts. Sometimes
I slept indeed; but the court-house of Inverary and the
prisoner glancing on all sides to find his missing witness,
followed me in slumber; and I would wake again with a
start to darkness of spirit and distress of body. I thought
Andie seemed to observe me, but I paid him little
heed. Verily, my bread was bitter to me, and my days
a burthen.</p>

<p>Early the next morning (Friday, 22nd) a boat came with
provisions, and Andie placed a packet in my hand. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148"></a>148</span>
cover was without address but sealed with a Government
seal. It enclosed two notes. &ldquo;Mr. Balfour can now see for
himself it is too late to meddle. His conduct will be
observed and his discretion rewarded.&rdquo; So ran the first,
which seemed to be laboriously writ with the left hand.
There was certainly nothing in these expressions to compromise
the writer, even if that person could be found; the
seal, which formidably served instead of signature, was
affixed to a separate sheet on which there was no scratch of
writing; and I had to confess that (so far) my adversaries
knew what they were doing, and to digest as well as I was
able the threat that peeped under the promise.</p>

<p>But the second enclosure was by far the more surprising.
It was in a lady&rsquo;s hand of writ. &ldquo;<i>Maister Dauvit Balfour
is informed a friend was speiring for him, and her eyes were
of the grey</i>,&rdquo; it ran&mdash;and seemed so extraordinary a piece to
come to my hands at such a moment and under cover of
a Government seal, that I stood stupid. Catriona&rsquo;s grey
eyes shone in my remembrance. I thought, with a bound
of pleasure, she must be the friend. But who should the
writer be, to have her billet thus enclosed with Prestongrange&rsquo;s?
And of all wonders, why was it thought needful
to give me this pleasing but most inconsequential intelligence
upon the Bass? For the writer, I could hit upon none
possible except Miss Grant. Her family, I remembered,
had remarked on Catriona&rsquo;s eyes, and even named her for
their colour; and she herself had been much in the habit
to address me with a broad pronunciation, by way of a sniff,
I supposed, at my rusticity. No doubt, besides, but she
lived in the same house as this letter came from. So there
remained but one step to be accounted for; and that was
how Prestongrange should have permitted her at all in an
affair so secret, or let her daft-like billet go in the same cover
with his own. But even here I had a glimmering. For,
first of all, there was something rather alarming about the
young lady, and papa might be more under her domination
than I knew. And second, there was the man&rsquo;s continual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149"></a>149</span>
policy to be remembered, how his conduct had been continually
mingled with caresses, and he had scarce ever, in
the midst of so much contention, laid aside a mask of friendship.
He must conceive that my imprisonment had incensed
me. Perhaps this little jesting, friendly message was
intended to disarm my rancour?</p>

<p>I will be honest&mdash;and I think it did. I felt a sudden
warmth towards that beautiful Miss Grant, that she should
stoop to so much interest in my affairs. The summoning
up of Catriona moved me of itself to milder and more
cowardly counsels. If the Advocate knew of her and of
our acquaintance&mdash;if I should please him by some of that
&ldquo;discretion&rdquo; at which his letter pointed&mdash;to what might
not this lead? <i>In vain is the net spread in the sight of any
fowl</i>, the scripture says. Well, fowls must be wiser than
folk! For I thought I perceived the policy, and yet fell in
with it.</p>

<p>I was in this frame, my heart beating, the grey eyes plain
before me like two stars, when Andie broke in upon my
musing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see ye hae gotten guid news,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>I found him looking curiously in my face; with that,
there came before me like a vision of James Stewart and the
court of Inverary; and my mind turned at once like a door
upon its hinges. Trials, I reflected, sometimes draw out
longer than is looked for. Even if I came to Inverary just
too late, something might yet be attempted in the interests
of James&mdash;and in those of my own character, the best would
be accomplished. In a moment, it seemed without thought,
I had a plan devised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andie,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is it still to be to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He told me nothing was changed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was anything said about the hour?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>He told me it was to be two o&rsquo;clock afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And about the place?&rdquo; I pursued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatten place?&rdquo; says Andie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The place I&rsquo;m to be landed at,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page150"></a>150</span></p>

<p>He owned there was nothing as to that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;this shall be mine to arrange.
The wind is in the east, my road lies westward; keep your
boat, I hire it; let us work up the Forth all day; and land
me at two o&rsquo;clock to-morrow at the westmost we&rsquo;ll can have
reached.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye daft callant!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;ye would try for Inverary
after a&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just that, Andie,&rdquo; says I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel, ye&rsquo;re ill to beat!&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;And I was kind
o&rsquo; sorry for ye a&rsquo; day yesterday,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Ye see, I
was never entirely sure till then, which way of it ye really
wantit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here was a spur to a lame horse!</p>

<p>&ldquo;A word in your ear, Andie,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;This plan of
mine has another advantage yet. We can leave these
Hielandmen behind us on the rock, and one of your boats
from the Castleton can bring them off to-morrow. Yon
Neil has a queer eye when he regards you; maybe, if I was
once out of the gate there might be knives again; these
red-shanks are unco grudgeful. And if there should come
to be any question, here is your excuse. Our lives were in
danger by these savages; being answerable for my safety,
you chose the part to bring me from their neighbourhood
and detain me the rest of the time on board your boat:
and do you know, Andie,&rdquo; says I, with a smile, &ldquo;I think it
was very wisely chosen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The truth is, I have nae goo for Neil,&rdquo; says Andie,
&ldquo;nor he for me, I&rsquo;m thinking; and I would like ill to come
to my hands wi&rsquo; the man. Tam Anster will make a better
hand of it with the cattle, onyway.&rdquo; (For this man, Anster,
came from Fife, where the Gaelic is still spoken.) &ldquo;Ay,
ay!&rdquo; says Andie, &ldquo;Tam&rsquo;ll can deal wi&rsquo; them the best.
And troth! the mair I think of it, the less I see what way
we would be required. The place&mdash;ay, feggs! they had
forgot the place. Eh, Shaws, ye&rsquo;re a lang-heided chield
when ye like! Forbye that I&rsquo;m awing ye my life,&rdquo; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151"></a>151</span>
added, with more solemnity, and offered me his hand upon
the bargain.</p>

<p>Whereupon, with scarce more words, we stepped
suddenly on board the boat, cast off, and set the lug. The
Gregara were then busy upon breakfast, for the cookery
was their usual part; but, one of them stepping to the
battlements, our flight was observed before we were twenty
fathoms from the rock; and the three of them ran about the
ruins and the landing-shelf, for all the world like ants about
a broken nest, hailing and crying on us to return. We were
still in both the lee and the shadow of the rock, which last
lay broad upon the waters, but presently came forth in
almost the same moment into the wind and sunshine;
the sail filled, the boat heeled to the gunwale, and we swept
immediately beyond sound of the men&rsquo;s voices. To what
terrors they endured upon the rock, where they were now
deserted without the countenance of any civilised person
or so much as the protection of a Bible, no limit can be set,
nor had they any brandy left to be their consolation, for
even in the haste and secrecy of our departure Andie had
managed to remove it.</p>

<p>It was our first care to set Anster ashore in a cove by the
Glenteithy Rocks, so that the deliverance of our maroons
might be duly seen to the next day. Thence we kept away
up Firth. The breeze, which was then so spirited, swiftly
declined, but never wholly failed us. All day we kept
moving, though often not much more; and it was after
dark ere we were up with the Queen&rsquo;s Ferry. To keep
the letter of Andie&rsquo;s engagement (or what was left of it) I
must remain on board, but I thought no harm to communicate
with the shore in writing. On Prestongrange&rsquo;s cover,
where the Government seal must have a good deal surprised
my correspondent, I writ, by the boat&rsquo;s lantern, a few
necessary words, and Andie carried them to Rankeillor.
In about an hour he came aboard again, with a purse of
money and the assurance that a good horse should be standing
saddled for me by two to-morrow at Clackmannan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152"></a>152</span>
Pool. This done, and the boat riding by her stone anchor,
we lay down to sleep under the sail.</p>

<p>We were in the Pool the next day long ere two; and
there was nothing left for me but sit and wait. I felt little
alacrity upon my errand. I would have been glad of any
passable excuse to lay it down; but, none being to be
found, my uneasiness was no less great than if I had been
running to some desired pleasure. By shortly after one
the horse was at the water-side, and I could see a man
walking it to and fro till I should land, which vastly swelled
my impatience. Andie ran the moment of liberation very
fine, showing himself a man of his bare word, but scarce
serving his employers with a heaped measure; and by about
fifty seconds after two I was in the saddle and on the full
stretch for Stirling. In a little more than an hour I had
passed that town and was already mounting Allan Water
side, when the weather broke in a small tempest. The rain
blinded me, the wind had nearly beat me from the saddle,
and the first darkness of the night surprised me in a wilderness
still some way east of Balwhidder, not very sure of my
direction, and mounted on a horse that began already to
be weary.</p>

<p>In the press of my hurry, and to be spared the delay
and annoyance of a guide, I had followed (so far as it was
possible for any horseman) the line of my journey with
Alan. This I did with open eyes, foreseeing a great risk in
it, which the tempest had now brought to a reality. The
last that I knew of where I was, I think it must have been
about Uam Var; the hour perhaps six at night. I must
still think it great good fortune that I got about eleven to
my destination, the house of Duncan Dhu. Where I had
wandered in the interval perhaps the horse could tell. I
know we were twice down, and once over the saddle and
for a moment carried away in a roaring burn. Steed and
rider were bemired up to the eyes.</p>

<p>From Duncan I had news of the trial. It was followed
in all these Highland regions with religious interest; news
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153"></a>153</span>
of it spread from Inverary as swift as men could travel;
and I was rejoiced to learn that, up to a late hour that
Saturday, it was not yet concluded: and all men began to
suppose it must spread over to the Monday. Under the
spur of this intelligence I would not sit to eat; but, Duncan
having agreed to be my guide, took the road again on foot,
with the piece in my hand and munching as I went. Duncan
brought with him a flask of usquebaugh and a hand-lantern;
which last enlightened us just so long as we could find
houses where to rekindle it, for the thing leaked outrageously
and blew out with every gust. The more part of
the night we walked blindfold among sheets of rain, and
day found us aimless on the mountains. Hard by we
struck a hut on a burn-side, where we got a bite and a
direction: and, a little before the end of the sermon, came
to the kirk-doors of Inverary.</p>

<p>The rain had somewhat washed the upper parts of me,
but I was still bogged as high as to the knees; I streamed
water; I was so weary I could hardly limp, and my face
was like a ghost&rsquo;s. I stood certainly more in need of a
change of raiment and a bed to lie on than of all the benefits
in Christianity. For all which (being persuaded the chief
point for me was to make myself immediately public) I set
the door open, entered that church with the dirty Duncan
at my tails, and, finding a vacant place hard by, sat down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thirteenthly, my brethren, and in parenthesis, the
law itself must be regarded as a means of grace,&rdquo; the
minister was saying, in the voice of one delighting to
pursue an argument.</p>

<p>The sermon was in English on account of the assize.
The judges were present with their armed attendants, the
halberts glittered in a corner by the door, and the seats
were thronged beyond custom with the array of lawyers.
The text was in Romans 5th and 13th&mdash;the minister a
skilled hand; and the whole of that able churchful&mdash;from
Argyle, and my Lords Elchies and Kilkerran, down
to the halbertmen that came in their attendance&mdash;was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154"></a>154</span>
sunk with gathered brows in a profound critical attention.
The minister himself and a sprinkling of those about the
door observed our entrance at the moment and immediately
forgot the same; the rest either did not hear or
would not heed; and I sat there amongst my friends and
enemies unremarked.</p>

<p>The first that I singled out was Prestongrange. He
sat well forward, like an eager horseman in the saddle,
his lips moving with relish, his eyes glued on the minister;
the doctrine was clearly to his mind. Charles Stewart,
on the other hand, was half-asleep, and looked harassed
and pale. As for Simon Fraser, he appeared like a blot,
and almost a scandal, in the midst of that attentive congregation,
digging his hands in his pockets, shifting his
legs, clearing his throat, rolling up his bald eyebrows and
shooting out his eyes to right and left, now with a yawn,
now with a secret smile. At times too, he would take the
Bible in front of him, run it through, seem to read a bit, run
it through again, and stop and yawn prodigiously: the
whole as if for exercise.</p>

<p>In the course of this restlessness his eye alighted on
myself. He sat a second stupefied, then tore a half leaf
out of the Bible, scrawled upon it with a pencil, and passed
it with a whispered word to his next neighbour. The note
came to Prestongrange, who gave me but the one look;
thence it voyaged to the hands of Mr. Erskine; thence
again to Argyle, where he sat between the other two lords
of session, and his Grace turned and fixed me with an
arrogant eye. The last of those interested to observe my
presence was Charlie Stewart, and he too began to pencil
and hand about despatches, none of which I was able to
trace to their destination in the crowd.</p>

<p>But the passage of these notes had aroused notice;
all who were in the secret (or supposed themselves to be
so) were whispering information&mdash;the rest questions; and
the minister himself seemed quite discountenanced by the
flutter in the church and sudden stir and whispering. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155"></a>155</span>
voice changed, he plainly faltered, nor did he again recover
the easy conviction and full tones of his delivery. It
would be a puzzle to him till his dying day, why a sermon
that had gone with triumph through four parts, should
thus miscarry in the fifth.</p>

<p>As for me, I continued to sit there, very wet and weary,
and a good deal anxious as to what should happen next,
but greatly exulting in my success.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII</h3>

<h5>THE MEMORIAL</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> last word of the blessing was scarce out of the minister&rsquo;s
mouth before Stewart had me by the arm. We were the
first to be forth of the church, and he made such extraordinary
expedition that we were safe within the four walls
of a house before the street had begun to be thronged with
the home-going congregation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I yet in time?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay and no,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The case is over; the jury is
enclosed, and will be so kind as let us ken their view of it to-morrow
in the morning, the same as I could have told it my
own self three days ago before the play began. The thing
has been public from the start. The panel kennt it, &lsquo;<i>Ye
may do what ye will for me</i>,&rsquo; whispers he two days ago. &lsquo;<i>I
ken my fate by what the Duke of Argyle has just said to Mr.
Macintosh.</i>&rsquo; O, it&rsquo;s been a scandal!</p>

<p>He was leaping with excitement, emptied out his mails
upon the floor that I might have a change of clothes, and incommoded
me with his assistance as I changed. What remained
to be done, or how I was to do it, was what he never
told me, nor, I believe, so much as thought of. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
ding the Campbells yet!&rdquo; that was still his owercome. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157"></a>157</span>
it was forced home upon my mind how this, that had the
externals of a sober process of law, was in its essence a clan
battle between savage clans. I thought my friend the
Writer none of the least savage. Who, that had only seen
him at a counsel&rsquo;s back before the Lord Ordinary, or following
a golf-ball and laying down his clubs on Bruntsfield
links, could have recognised for the same person this voluble
and violent clansman?</p>

<p>James Stewart&rsquo;s counsel were four in number&mdash;Sheriffs
Brown of Colstoun and Miller, Mr. Robert Macintosh and
Mr. Stewart, younger of Stewart Hall. These were covenanted
to dine with the Writer after sermon, and I was very
obligingly included of the party. No sooner the cloth lifted,
and the first bowl very artfully compounded by Sheriff
Miller, than we fell to the subject in hand. I made a short
narration of my seizure and captivity, and was then examined
and re-examined upon the circumstances of the
murder. It will be remembered this was the first time I
had had my say out, or the matter at all handled, among
lawyers; and the consequence was very dispiriting to the
others and (I must own) disappointing to myself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To sum up,&rdquo; said Colstoun, &ldquo;you prove that Alan was
on the spot; you have heard him proffer menaces against
Glenure; and though you assure us he was not the man who
fired, you leave a strong impression that he was in league
with him, and consenting, perhaps immediately assisting, in
the act. You show him besides, at the risk of his own liberty,
actively furthering the criminal&rsquo;s escape. And the rest of
your testimony (so far as the least material) depends on the
bare word of Alan or of James, the two accused. In short,
you do not at all break, but only lengthen by one personage,
the chain that binds our client to the murderer; and I need
scarcely say that the introduction of a third accomplice
rather aggravates that appearance of a conspiracy which
has been our stumbling-block from the beginning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am of the same opinion,&rdquo; said Sheriff Miller. &ldquo;I
think we may all be very much obliged to Prestongrange for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158"></a>158</span>
taking a most uncomfortable witness out of our way. And
chiefly, I think, Mr. Balfour himself might be obliged. For
you talk of a third accomplice, but Mr. Balfour (in my view)
has very much the appearance of a fourth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Allow me, sirs!&rdquo; interposed Stewart the Writer.
&ldquo;There is another view. Here we have a witness&mdash;never
fash whether material or not&mdash;a witness in this cause, kidnapped
by that old, lawless, bandit crew of the Glengyle
Macgregors, and sequestered for near upon a month in a
bourock of old cold ruins on the Bass. Move that and see
what dirt you fling on the proceedings! Sirs, this is a tale
to make the world ring with! It would be strange, with
such a grip as this, if we couldna squeeze out a pardon for my
client.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And suppose we took up Mr. Balfour&rsquo;s cause to-morrow?&rdquo;
said Stewart Hall. &ldquo;I am much deceived or we
should find so many impediments thrown in our path, as
that James should have been hanged before we had found a
court to hear us. This is a great scandal, but I suppose we
have none of us forgot a greater still, I mean the matter of
the Lady Grange. The woman was still in durance; my
friend Mr. Hope of Rankeillor did what was humanly
possible; and how did he speed? He never got a warrant!
Well, it&rsquo;ll be the same now; the same weapons will be used.
This is a scene, gentlemen, of clan animosity. The hatred
of the name which I have the honour to bear rages in high
quarters. There is nothing here to be viewed but naked
Campbell spite and scurvy Campbell intrigue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You may be sure this was to touch a welcome topic, and
I sat for some time in the midst of my learned counsel,
almost deaved with their talk, but extremely little the wiser
for its purport. The Writer was led into some hot expressions;
Colstoun must take him up and set him right; the
rest joined in on different sides, but all pretty noisy; the
Duke of Argyle was beaten like a blanket; King George
came in for a few digs in the by-going and a great deal of
rather elaborate defence: and there was only one person
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159"></a>159</span>
that seemed to be forgotten, and that was James of the
Glens.</p>

<p>Through all this Mr. Miller sat quiet. He was a slip of
an oldish gentleman, ruddy and twinkling; he spoke in a
smooth rich voice, with an infinite effect of pawkiness, dealing
out each word the way an actor does, to give the most
expression possible; and even now, when he was silent, and
sat there with his wig laid aside, his glass in both hands, his
mouth funnily pursed, and his chin out, he seemed the mere
picture of a merry slyness. It was plain he had a word to
say, and waited for the fit occasion.</p>

<p>It came presently. Colstoun had wound up one of his
speeches with some expression of their duty to their client.
His brother sheriff was pleased, I suppose, with the transition.
He took the table in his confidence with a gesture and
a look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That suggests to me a consideration which seems overlooked,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;The interest of our client goes certainly
before all, but the world does not come to an end with James
Stewart.&rdquo; Whereat he cocked his eye. &ldquo;I might condescend,
<i>exempli gratia</i>, upon a Mr. George Brown, a Mr.
Thomas Miller, and a Mr. David Balfour. Mr. David Balfour
has a very good ground of complaint, and I think,
gentlemen&mdash;if his story was properly redd out&mdash;I think
there would be a number of wigs on the green.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The whole table turned to him with a common
movement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Properly handled and carefully redd out, his is a story
that could scarcely fail to have some consequence,&rdquo; he continued.
&ldquo;The whole administration of justice, from its
highest officer downward, would be totally discredited; and
it looks to me as if they would need to be replaced.&rdquo; He
seemed to shine with cunning as he said it. &ldquo;And I need
not point out to ye that this of Mr. Balfour&rsquo;s would be a
remarkable bonny cause to appear in,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>Well, there they all were started on another hare; Mr.
Balfour&rsquo;s cause, and what kind of speeches could be there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160"></a>160</span>
delivered, and what officials could be thus turned out, and
who would succeed to their positions. I shall give but the
two specimens. It was proposed to approach Simon Fraser,
whose testimony, if it could be obtained, would prove certainly
fatal to Argyle and Prestongrange. Miller highly
approved of the attempt. &ldquo;We have here before us a
dreeping roast,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;here is cut-and-come-again for
all.&rdquo; And methought all licked their lips. The other was
already near the end. Stewart the Writer was out of the
body with delight, smelling vengeance on his chief enemy,
the Duke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; cried he, charging his glass, &ldquo;here is to
Sheriff Miller. His legal abilities are known to all. His
culinary, this bowl in front of us is here to speak for. But
when it comes to the poleetical!&rdquo;&mdash;cries he, and drains the
glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, but it will hardly prove politics in your meaning,
my friend,&rdquo; said the gratified Miller. &ldquo;A revolution, if you
like, and I think I can promise you that historical writers
shall date from Mr. Balfour&rsquo;s cause. But, properly guided,
Mr. Stewart, tenderly guided, it shall prove a peaceful
revolution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if the damned Campbells get their ears rubbed,
what care I?&rdquo; cries Stewart, smiting down his fist.</p>

<p>It will be thought I was not very well pleased with all
this, though I could scarce forbear smiling at a kind of innocency
in these old intriguers. But it was not my view to
have undergone so many sorrows for the advancement of
Sheriff Miller or to make a revolution in the Parliament
House: and I interposed accordingly with as much simplicity
of manner as I could assume.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to thank you, gentlemen, for your advice,&rdquo; said
I. &ldquo;And now I would like, by your leave, to set you two
or three questions. There is one thing that has fallen rather
on one side,&mdash;for instance: Will this cause do any good to
our friend James of the Glens?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They seemed all a hair set back, and gave various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161"></a>161</span>
answers, but concurring practically in one point, that James
had now no hope but in the King&rsquo;s mercy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To proceed, then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;will it do any good to
Scotland? We have a saying that it is an ill bird that fouls
his own nest. I remember hearing we had a riot in Edinburgh
when I was an infant child, which gave occasion to
the late Queen to call this country barbarous; and I always
understood that we had rather lost than gained by that.
Then came the year &rsquo;Forty-five, which made Scotland to be
talked of everywhere; but I never heard it said we had anyway
gained by the &rsquo;Forty-five. And now we come to this
cause of Mr. Balfour&rsquo;s, as you call it. Sheriff Miller tells us
historical writers are to date from it, and I would not wonder.
It is only my fear they would date from it as a period of
calamity and public reproach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The nimble-witted Miller had already smelt where I was
travelling to, and made haste to get on the same road.
&ldquo;Forcibly put, Mr. Balfour,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;A weighty observe,
sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have next to ask ourselves if it will be good for
King George,&rdquo; I pursued. &ldquo;Sheriff Miller appears pretty
easy upon this; but I doubt you will scarce be able to pull
down the house from under him, without his Majesty coming
by a knock or two, one of which might easily prove
fatal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I gave them a chance to answer, but none volunteered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of those for whom the case was to be profitable,&rdquo; I
went on, &ldquo;Sheriff Miller gave us the names of several,
among the which he was good enough to mention mine.
I hope he will pardon me if I think otherwise. I believe I
hung not the least back in this affair while there was life to be
saved; but I own I thought myself extremely hazarded, and
I own I think it would be a pity for a young man, with some
idea of coming to the Bar, to ingrain upon himself the character
of a turbulent, factious fellow before he was yet twenty.
As for James, it seems&mdash;at this date of the proceedings, with
the sentence as good as pronounced&mdash;he has no hope but in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162"></a>162</span>
the King&rsquo;s mercy. May not his Majesty, then, be more
pointedly addressed, the characters of these high officers
sheltered from the public, and myself kept out of a position
which I think spells ruin for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all sat and gazed into their glasses, and I could see
they found my attitude on the affair unpalatable. But
Miller was ready at all events.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I may be allowed to put our young friend&rsquo;s notion in
more formal shape,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I understand him to propose
that we should embody the fact of his sequestration, and
perhaps some heads of the testimony he was prepared to
offer, in a memorial to the Crown. This plan has elements
of success. It is as likely as any other (and perhaps likelier)
to help our client. Perhaps his Majesty would have the
goodness to feel a certain gratitude to all concerned in such
a memorial, which might be construed into an expression
of a very delicate loyalty; and I think, in the drafting of the
same, this view might be brought forward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all nodded to each other, not without sighs, for
the former alternative was doubtless more after their inclination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paper then, Mr. Stewart, if you please,&rdquo; pursued
Miller; &ldquo;and I think it might very fittingly be signed by the
five of us here present, as procurators for the &lsquo;condemned
man.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can do none of us any harm at least,&rdquo; says Colstoun,
heaving another sigh, for he had seen himself Lord Advocate
the last ten minutes.</p>

<p>Thereupon they set themselves, not very enthusiastically,
to draft the memorial&mdash;a process in the course of which they
soon caught fire; and I had no more ado but to sit looking on
and answer an occasional question. The paper was very
well expressed; beginning with a recitation of the facts
about myself, the reward offered for my apprehension, my
surrender, the pressure brought to bear upon me; my sequestration;
and my arrival at Inverary in time to be too
late; going on to explain the reasons of loyalty and public
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163"></a>163</span>
interest for which it was agreed to waive any right of action;
and winding up with a forcible appeal to the King&rsquo;s mercy
on behalf of James.</p>

<p>Methought I was a good deal sacrificed, and rather represented
in the light of a firebrand of a fellow whom my cloud
of lawyers had restrained with difficulty from extremes.
But I let it pass, and made but the one suggestion, that I
should be described as ready to deliver my own evidence
and adduce that of others before any commission of inquiry
&mdash;and the one demand, that I should be immediately furnished
with a copy.</p>

<p>Colstoun hummed and hawed. &ldquo;This is a very confidential
document,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And my position towards Prestongrange is highly
peculiar,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;No question but I must have touched
his heart at our first interview, so that he has since stood my
friend consistently. But for him, gentlemen, I must now be
lying dead, or awaiting my sentence alongside poor James.
For which reason I choose to communicate to him the fact
of this memorial as soon as it is copied. You are to consider
also that this step will make for my protection. I have
enemies here accustomed to drive hard; his Grace is in his
own country, Lovat by his side; and if there should hang
any ambiguity over our proceedings I think I might very
well awake in gaol.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not finding any very ready answer to these considerations,
my company of advisers were at the last persuaded to
consent, and made only this condition, that I was to lay the
paper before Prestongrange with the express compliments
of all concerned.</p>

<p>The Advocate was at the castle dining with his Grace.
By the hand of one of Colstoun&rsquo;s servants I sent him a billet
asking for an interview, and received a summons to meet
him at once in a private house of the town. Here I found
him alone in a chamber; from his face there was nothing to
be gleaned; yet I was not so unobservant but what I spied
some halberts in the hall, and not so stupid but what I could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164"></a>164</span>
gather he was prepared to arrest me there and then, should
it appear advisable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, Mr. David, this is you?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where I fear I am not overly welcome, my lord,&rdquo; said
I. &ldquo;And I would like before I go further to express my
sense of your lordship&rsquo;s continued good offices, even should
they now cease.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard of your gratitude before,&rdquo; he replied
drily, &ldquo;and I think this can scarce be the matter you called
me from my wine to listen to. I would remember also, if I
were you, that you still stand on a very boggy foundation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not now, my lord, I think,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and if your lordship
will but glance an eye along this, you will perhaps think
as I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He read it sedulously through, frowning heavily; then
turned back to one part and another which he seemed to
weigh and compare the effect of. His face a little lightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is not so bad but what it might be worse,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;though I am still likely to pay dear for my acquaintance
with Mr. David Balfour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather for your indulgence to that unlucky young
man, my lord,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>He still skimmed the paper, and all the while his spirits
seemed to mend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And to whom am I indebted for this?&rdquo; he asked
presently. &ldquo;Other counsels must have been discussed, I
think. Who was it proposed this private method? Was it
Miller?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord, it was myself,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;These gentlemen
have shown me no such consideration, as that I should deny
myself any credit I can fairly claim, or spare them any
responsibility they should properly bear. And the mere
truth is, that they were all in favour of a process which
should have remarkable consequences in the Parliament
House, and prove for them (in one of their own expressions)
a dripping roast. Before I intervened, I think they were on
the point of sharing out the different law appointments.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165"></a>165</span>
Our friend Mr. Simon was to be taken in upon some composition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prestongrange smiled. &ldquo;These are our friends!&rdquo; said
he. &ldquo;And what were your reasons for dissenting, Mr.
David?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told them without concealment, expressing, however,
with more force and volume those which regarded Prestongrange
himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do me no more than justice,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have
fought as hard in your interest as you have fought against
mine. And how came you here to-day?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;As
the case drew out, I began to grow uneasy that I had clipped
the period so fine, and I was even expecting you to-morrow.
But to-day&mdash;I never dreamed of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was not, of course, going to betray Andie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suspect there is some very weary cattle by the road,&rdquo;
said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I had known you were such a moss-trooper you
should have tasted longer of the Bass,&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speaking of which, my lord, I return your letter.&rdquo;
And I gave him the enclosure in the counterfeit
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was the cover also with the seal,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have it not,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It bore not even an address,
and could not compromise a cat. The second enclosure I
have, and with your permission, I desire to keep it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought he winced a little, but he said nothing to the
point. &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;our business here is
to be finished, and I proceed by Glasgow. I would be very
glad to have you of my party, Mr. David.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord ...&rdquo; I began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not deny it will be of service to me,&rdquo; he interrupted.
&ldquo;I desire even that, when we shall come to Edinburgh,
you should alight at my house. You have very
warm friends in the Miss Grants, who will be overjoyed to
have you to themselves. If you think I have been of use
to you, you can thus easily repay me, and so far from losing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166"></a>166</span>
may reap some advantage by the way. It is not every
strange young man who is presented in society by the King&rsquo;s
Advocate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Often enough already (in our brief relations) this gentleman
had caused my head to spin; no doubt but what for a
moment he did so again now. Here was the old fiction still
maintained of my particular favour with his daughters, one
of whom had been so good as laugh at me, while the other
two had scarce deigned to remark the fact of my existence.
And now I was to ride with my lord to Glasgow; I was to
dwell with him in Edinburgh; I was to be brought into
society under his protection! That he should have so much
good-nature as to forgive me was surprising enough; that
he could wish to take me up and serve me seemed impossible;
and I began to seek for some ulterior meaning. One
was plain. If I became his guest, repentance was excluded;
I could never think better of my present design and bring
any action. And besides, would not my presence in his
house draw out the whole pungency of the memorial? For
that complaint could not be very seriously regarded, if the
person chiefly injured was the guest of the official most incriminated.
As I thought upon this, I could not quite
refrain from smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is in the nature of a countercheck to the memorial?&rdquo;
said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are cunning, Mr. David,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and you do
not wholly guess wrong; the fact will be of use to me in my
defence. Perhaps, however, you underrate my friendly
sentiments, which are perfectly genuine. I have a respect
for you, Mr. David, mingled with awe,&rdquo; says he, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am more than willing, I am earnestly desirous to
meet your wishes,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It is my design to be called to
the Bar, where your lordship&rsquo;s countenance would be invaluable;
and I am besides sincerely grateful to yourself
and family for different marks of interest and of indulgence.
The difficulty is here. There is one point in which we pull
two ways. You are trying to hang James Stewart, I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167"></a>167</span>
trying to save him. In so far as my riding with you would
better your lordship&rsquo;s defence, I am at your lordship&rsquo;s orders;
but in so far as it would help to hang James Stewart, you
see me at a stick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought he swore to himself. &ldquo;You should certainly
be called; the Bar is the true scene for your talents,&rdquo; says
he bitterly, and then fell a while silent. &ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo;
he presently resumed, &ldquo;there is no question of James
Stewart, for or against. James is a dead man; his life is
given and taken&mdash;bought (if you like it better) and sold; no
memorial can help&mdash;no defalcation of a faithful Mr. David
hurt him. Blow high, blow low, there will be no pardon for
James Stewart: and take that for said! The question is
now of myself: am I to stand or fall? and I do not deny to
you that I am in some danger. But will Mr. David Balfour
consider why? It is not because I have pushed the case
unduly against James; for that, I am sure of condonation.
And it is not because I have sequestered Mr. David on a
rock, though it will pass under that colour; but because I
did not take the ready and plain path, to which I was pressed
repeatedly, and send Mr. David to his grave or to the gallows.
Hence the scandal&mdash;hence this damned memorial,&rdquo; striking
the paper on his leg. &ldquo;My tenderness for you has brought
me in this difficulty. I wish to know if your tenderness to
your own conscience is too great to let you help me out
of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No doubt but there was much of the truth in what he
said; if James was past helping, whom was it more natural
that I should turn to help than just the man before me, who
had helped myself so often, and was even now setting me a
pattern of patience? I was besides not only weary, but
beginning to be ashamed of my perpetual attitude of suspicion
and refusal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will name the time and place, I will be punctually
ready to attend your lordship,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>He shook hands with me. &ldquo;And I think my misses
have some news for you,&rdquo; says he, dismissing me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page168"></a>168</span></p>

<p>I came away, vastly pleased to have my peace made,
yet a little concerned in conscience; nor could I help wondering,
as I went back, whether, perhaps, I had not been a
scruple too good-natured. But there was the fact, that this
was a man that might have been my father, an able man, a
great dignitary, and one that, in the hour of my need, had
reached a hand to my assistance. I was in the better
humour to enjoy the remainder of that evening, which I
passed with the advocates, in excellent company no doubt,
but perhaps with rather more than a sufficiency of punch:
for though I went early to bed I have no clear mind of how I
got there.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII</h3>

<h5>THE TEE&rsquo;D BALL</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">On</span> the morrow, from the justices&rsquo; private room, where none
could see me, I heard the verdict given in and judgment
rendered upon James. The Duke&rsquo;s words I am quite sure
I have correctly; and since that famous passage has been
made a subject of dispute, I may as well commemorate my
version. Having referred to the year &rsquo;Forty-five, the chief
of the Campbells, sitting as Justice General upon the Bench,
thus addressed the unfortunate Stewart before him: &ldquo;If
you had been successful in that rebellion, you might have
been giving the law where you have now received the judgment
of it; we, who are this day your judges, might have
been tried before one of your mock courts of judicature; and
then you might have been satiated with the blood of any
name or clan to which you had an aversion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is to let the cat out of the bag indeed,&rdquo; thought I.
And that was the general impression. It was extraordinary
how the young advocate lads took hold and made a mock of
this speech, and how scarce a meal passed but what some one
would get in the words: &ldquo;And then you might have been
satiated.&rdquo; Many songs were made in that time for the hour&rsquo;s
diversion, and are near all forgot. I remember one began:</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;What do ye want the bluid of, bluid of?</p>
    <p class="i2">Is it a name, or is it a clan,</p>
    <p class="i2">Or is it an aefauld Hielandman,</p>
<p class="i05">That ye want the bluid of, bluid of?&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">Another went to my old favourite air, &ldquo;The House of
Airlie,&rdquo; and began thus:</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;It fell on a day when Argyle was on the bench,</p>
<p class="i05">That they served him a Stewart for his denner.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page170"></a>170</span></p>

<p class="noind">And one of the verses ran:</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;Then up and spak the Duke, and flyted on his cook,</p>
  <p class="i2">I regaird it as a sensible aspersion,</p>
<p class="i05">That I would sup ava&rsquo;, an&rsquo; satiate my maw</p>
  <p class="i2">With the bluid of ony clan of my aversion.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>James was as fairly murdered as though the Duke had
got a fowling-piece and stalked him. So much of course I
knew: but others knew not so much, and were more affected
by the items of scandal that came to light in the progress of
the cause. One of the chief was certainly this sally of the
Justice&rsquo;s. It was run hard by another of a juryman, who
had struck into the midst of Colstoun&rsquo;s speech for the defence
with a &ldquo;Pray, sir, cut it short, we are quite weary,&rdquo;
which seemed the very excess of impudence and simplicity.
But some of my new lawyer friends were still more staggered
with an innovation that had disgraced and even vitiated the
proceedings. One witness was never called. His name,
indeed, was printed, where it may still be seen on the fourth
page of the list: &ldquo;James Drummond, <i>alias</i> Macgregor,
<i>alias</i> James More, late tenant in Inveronachile&rdquo;; and his
precognition had been taken, as the manner is, in writing.
He had remembered or invented (God help him) matter
which was lead in James Stewart&rsquo;s shoes, and I saw was like
to prove wings to his own. This testimony it was highly
desirable to bring to the notice of the jury, without exposing
the man himself to the perils of cross-examination, and the
way it was brought about was a matter of surprise to all.
For the paper was handed round (like a curiosity) in court;
passed through the jury-box, where it did its work; and disappeared
again (as though by accident) before it reached the
counsel for the prisoner. This was counted a most insidious
device; and that the name of James More should be mingled
up with it filled me with shame for Catriona and concern for
myself.</p>

<p>The following day, Prestongrange and I, with a considerable
company, set out for Glasgow, where (to my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171"></a>171</span>
impatience) we continued to linger some time in a mixture of
pleasure and affairs. I lodged with my lord, with whom I
was encouraged to familiarity; had my place at entertainments;
was presented to the chief guests; and altogether
made more of than I thought accorded either with my parts
or station; so that, on strangers being present, I would
often blush for Prestongrange. It must be owned the view
I had taken of the world in these last months was fit to cast
a gloom upon my character. I had met many men, some of
them leaders in Israel, whether by their birth or talents;
and who among them all had shown clean hands? As for
the Browns and Millers, I had seen their self-seeking, I could
never again respect them. Prestongrange was the best yet;
he had saved me, had spared me rather, when others had it
in their minds to murder me outright; but the blood of
James lay at his door; and I thought his present dissimulation
with myself a thing below pardon. That he should
affect to find a pleasure in my discourse almost surprised me
out of my patience. I would sit and watch him with a kind
of a slow fire of anger in my bowels. &ldquo;Ah, friend, friend,&rdquo; I
would think to myself, &ldquo;if you were but through with this
affair of the memorial, would you not kick me in the
streets?&rdquo; Here I did him, as events have proved, the most
grave injustice; and I think he was at once far more sincere,
and a far more artful performer, than I supposed.</p>

<p>But I had some warrant for my incredulity in the behaviour
of that court of young advocates that hung about
him in the hope of patronage. The sudden favour of a lad
not previously heard of troubled them at first out of measure,
but two days were not gone by before I found myself surrounded
with flattery and attention. I was the same young
man, and neither better nor bonnier, that they had rejected
a month before; and now there was no civility too fine for
me! The same, do I say? It was not so; and the by-name
by which I went behind my back confirmed it. Seeing me
so firm with the Advocate, and persuaded that I was to fly
high and far, they had taken a word from the golfing green,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172"></a>172</span>
and called me <i>the Tee&rsquo;d Ball</i>.<a name="FnAnchor_14" href="#Footnote_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a> I was told I was now &ldquo;one
of themselves&rdquo;; I was to taste of their soft lining, who had
already made my own experience of the roughness of the
outer husk; and one, to whom I had been presented in
Hope Park, was so assured as even to remind me of that
meeting. I told him I had not the pleasure of remembering
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;it was Miss Grant herself presented
me! My name is So-and-so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may very well be, sir,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but I have kept no
mind of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At which he desisted; and in the midst of the disgust
that commonly overflowed my spirits I had a glisk of
pleasure.</p>

<p>But I have not patience to dwell upon that time at
length. When I was in company with these young politics
I was borne down with shame for myself and my own plain
ways, and scorn for them and their duplicity. Of the two
evils, I thought Prestongrange to be the least; and while I
was always as stiff as buckram to the young bloods, I made
rather a dissimulation of my hard feelings towards the
Advocate, and was (in old Mr. Campbell&rsquo;s word) &ldquo;soople to
the laird.&rdquo; Himself commented on the difference, and bid
me be more of my age, and make friends with my young
comrades.</p>

<p>I told him I was slow of making friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will take the word back,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But there is
such a thing as <i>Fair gude-e&rsquo;en and fair gude-day</i>, Mr. David.
These are the same young men with whom you are to pass
your days and get through life: your backwardness has a
look of arrogance; and unless you can assume a little more
lightness of manner, I fear you will meet difficulties in the
path.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be an ill job to make a silk purse of a sow&rsquo;s ear,&rdquo;
said I.</p>

<p>On the morning of October 1st I was awakened by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173"></a>173</span>
clattering in of an express; and, getting to my window
almost before he had dismounted, I saw the messenger had
ridden hard. Somewhile after I was called to Prestongrange,
where he was sitting in his bedgown and nightcap, with his
letters round him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. David,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have a piece of news for you.
It concerns some friends of yours, of whom I sometimes
think you are a little ashamed, for you have never referred
to their existence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I suppose I blushed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you understand, since you make the answering
signal,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And I must compliment you on your
excellent taste in beauty. But do you know, Mr. David,
this seems to me a very enterprising lass? She crops up
from every side. The Government of Scotland appears
unable to proceed for Mistress Katrine Drummond, which
was somewhat the case (no great while back) with a certain
Mr. David Balfour. Should not these make a good match?
Her first intromission in politics&mdash;but I must not tell you
that story, the authorities have decided you are to hear it
otherwise and from a livelier narrator. This new example
is more serious, however; and I am afraid I must alarm you
with the intelligence that she is now in prison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I cried out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the little lady is in prison. But I
would not have you to despair. Unless you (with your
friends and memorials) shall procure my downfall, she is to
suffer nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what has she done? What is her offence?&rdquo; I
cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might be almost construed a high treason,&rdquo;
he returned, &ldquo;for she has broke the King&rsquo;s Castle of
Edinburgh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lady is much my friend,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I know you
would not mock me if the thing were serious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet it is serious in a sense,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;for this
rogue of a Katrine&mdash;or Cateran, as we may call her&mdash;has set
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174"></a>174</span>
adrift again upon the world that very doubtful character,
her papa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here was one of my previsions justified: James More
was once again at liberty. He had lent his men to keep me
a prisoner; he had volunteered his testimony in the Appin
case, and the same (no matter by what subterfuge) had been
employed to influence the jury. Now came his reward, and
he was free. It might please the authorities to give to it the
colour of an escape; but I knew better&mdash;I knew it must be
the fulfilment of a bargain. The same course of thought
relieved me of the least alarm for Catriona. She might be
thought to have broke prison for her father; she might have
believed so herself. But the chief hand in the whole business
was that of Prestongrange; and I was sure, so far from
letting her come to punishment, he would not suffer her to
be even tried. Whereupon thus came out of me the not
very politic ejaculation:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! I was expecting that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have at times a great deal of discretion too!&rdquo; says
Prestongrange.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is my lord pleased to mean by that?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just marvelling,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that being so
clever as to draw these inferences, you should not be clever
enough to keep them to yourself. But I think you would
like to hear the details of the affair. I have received two
versions: and the least official is the more full and far the
more entertaining, being from the lively pen of my eldest
daughter. &lsquo;Here is all the town bizzing with a fine piece of
work,&rsquo; she writes, &lsquo;and what would make the thing more
noted (if it were only known) the malefactor is a <i>protégée</i> of
his lordship my papa. I am sure your heart is too much in
your duty (if it were nothing else) to have forgotten Grey
Eyes. What does she do, but get a broad hat with the flaps
open, a long hairy-like man&rsquo;s great-coat, and a big gravatt;
kilt her coats up to <i>Gude kens whaur</i>, clap two pair of boot-hose
upon her legs, take a pair of <i>clouted brogues</i><a name="FnAnchor_15" href="#Footnote_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a> in her hand,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175"></a>175</span>
and off to the Castle! Here she gives herself out to be a
soutar<a name="FnAnchor_16" href="#Footnote_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a> in the employ of James More, and gets admitted to
his cell, the lieutenant (who seems to have been full of pleasantry)
making sport among his soldiers of the soutar&rsquo;s great-coat.
Presently they hear disputation and the sound of
blows inside. Out flies the cobbler, his coat flying, the flaps
of his hat beat about his face, and the lieutenant and his
soldiers mock at him as he runs off. They laugh not so
hearty the next time they had occasion to visit the cell, and
found nobody but a tall, pretty, grey-eyed lass in the female
habit! As for the cobbler, he was &ldquo;over the hills ayont
Dumblane,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s thought that poor Scotland will have to
console herself without him. I drank Catriona&rsquo;s health this
night in public. Indeed, the whole town admires her; and I
think the beaux would wear bits of her garters in their
button-holes if they could only get them. I would have
gone to visit her in prison too, only I remembered in time
I was papa&rsquo;s daughter; so I wrote her a billet instead, which
I entrusted to the faithful Doig, and I hope you will admit
I can be political when I please. The same faithful gomeril
is to despatch this letter by the express along with those of
the wiseacres, so that you may hear Tom Fool in company
with Solomon. Talking of <i>gomerils</i>, do tell <i>Dauvit Balfour</i>.
I would I could see the face of him at the thought of a long-legged
lass in such a predicament! to say nothing of the
levities of your affectionate daughter, and his respectful
friend.&rsquo; So my rascal signs herself!&rdquo; continued Prestongrange.
&ldquo;And you see, Mr. David, it is quite true what I
tell you, that my daughters regard you with the most affectionate
playfulness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gomeril is much obliged,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And was not this prettily done?&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Is
not this Highland maid a piece of a heroine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was always sure she had a great heart,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;And
I wager she guessed nothing.... But I beg your pardon,
this is to tread upon forbidden subjects.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page176"></a>176</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go bail she did not,&rdquo; he returned, quite openly.
&ldquo;I will go bail she thought she was flying straight into King
George&rsquo;s face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Remembrance of Catriona, and the thought of her lying
in captivity, moved me strangely. I could see that even
Prestongrange admired, and could not withhold his lips from
smiling when he considered her behaviour. As for Miss
Grant, for all her ill habit of mockery, her admiration shone
out plain. A kind of a heat came on me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not your lordship&rsquo;s daughter ...&rdquo; I began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I know of!&rdquo; he put in, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I speak like a fool,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;or rather I began wrong.
It would doubtless be unwise in Mistress Grant to go to her
in prison; but for me, I think I would look like a half-hearted
friend if I did not fly there instantly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So-ho, Mr. David,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;I thought that you and
I were in a bargain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;when I made that bargain I was a
good deal affected by your goodness, but I&rsquo;ll never can deny
that I was moved besides by my own interest. There was
self-seeking in my heart, and I think shame of it now. It
may be for your lordship&rsquo;s safety to say this fashious Davie
Balfour is your friend and housemate. Say it then; I&rsquo;ll
never contradict you. But as for your patronage, I give it
all back. I ask but one thing&mdash;let me go, and give me a pass
to see her in her prison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at me with a hard eye. &ldquo;You put the cart
before the horse, I think,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;That which I had
given was a portion of my liking, which your thankless
nature does not seem to have remarked. But for my patronage,
it is not given, nor (to be exact) is it yet offered.&rdquo;
He paused a bit. &ldquo;And I warn you, you do not know yourself,&rdquo;
he added. &ldquo;Youth is a hasty season; you will think
better of all this before a year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and I would like to be that kind of youth!&rdquo; I
cried. &ldquo;I have seen too much of the other party in these
young advocates that fawn upon your lordship, and are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177"></a>177</span>
even at the pains to fawn on me. And I have seen it in the
old ones also. They are all for by-ends, the whole clan of
them! It&rsquo;s this that makes me seem to misdoubt your lordship&rsquo;s
liking. Why would I think that you would like me?
But ye told me yourself ye had an interest!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I stopped at this, confounded that I had run so far; he
was observing me with an unfathomable face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord, I ask your pardon,&rdquo; I resumed. &ldquo;I have
nothing in my chafts but a rough country tongue. I think
it would be only decent-like if I would go to see my friend in
her captivity; but I&rsquo;m owing you my life&mdash;I&rsquo;ll never forget
that; and if it&rsquo;s for your lordship&rsquo;s good, here I&rsquo;ll stay.
That&rsquo;s barely gratitude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This might have been reached in fewer words,&rdquo; says
Prestongrange grimly. &ldquo;It is easy, and it is at times
gracious, to say a plain Scots &lsquo;ay.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but, my lord, I think ye take me not yet entirely!&rdquo;
cried I. &ldquo;For <i>your</i> sake, for my life-safe, and the kindness
that ye say ye bear to me&mdash;for these I&rsquo;ll consent; but not
for any good that might be coming to myself. If I stand
aside when this young maid is in her trial, it&rsquo;s a thing I will
be noways advantaged by; I will lose by it, I will never gain.
I would rather make a shipwreck wholly than to build on
that foundation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was a minute serious, then smiled. &ldquo;You mind me
of the man with the long nose,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;was you to look
at the moon by a telescope, you would see David Balfour
there! But you shall have your way of it. I will ask at
you one service, and then set you free. My clerks are over-driven;
be so good as copy me these few pages,&rdquo; says he,
visibly swithering among some huge rolls of manuscripts,
&ldquo;and when that is done, I shall bid you God-speed! I would
never charge myself with Mr. David&rsquo;s conscience; and if you
could cast some part of it (as you went by) in a moss-hag,
you would find yourself to ride much easier without it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not just entirely in the same direction though,
my lord!&rdquo; says I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page178"></a>178</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And you shall have the last word too!&rdquo; cries he gaily.</p>

<p>Indeed he had some cause for gaiety, having now found
the means to gain his purpose. To lessen the weight of the
memorial, or to have a readier answer at his hand, he desired
I should appear publicly in the character of his intimate.
But if I were to appear with the same publicity as a visitor
to Catriona in her prison the world would scarce stint to
draw conclusions, and the true nature of James More&rsquo;s
escape must become evident to all. This was the little
problem I had set him of a sudden, and to which he had so
briskly found an answer. I was to be tethered in Glasgow
by that job of copying, which in mere outward decency I
could not well refuse; and during these hours of my employment
Catriona was to be privately got rid of. I think
shame to write of this man that loaded me with so many
goodnesses. He was kind to me as any father, yet I ever
thought him as false as a cracked bell.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX</h3>

<h5>I AM MUCH IN THE HANDS OF THE LADIES</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> copying was a weary business, the more so as I perceived
very early there was no sort of urgency in the matters
treated, and began very early to consider my employment a
pretext. I had no sooner finished than I got to horse, used
what remained of daylight to the best purpose, and being at
last fairly benighted, slept in a house by Almond Waterside.
I was in the saddle again before the day, and the
Edinburgh booths were just opening when I clattered in by
the West Bow, and drew up a smoking horse at my Lord
Advocate&rsquo;s door. I had a written word for Doig, my lord&rsquo;s
private hand that was thought to be in all his secrets&mdash;a
worthy, little plain man, all fat and snuff and self-sufficiency.
Him I found already at his desk, and already bedabbled with
maccabaw, in the same anteroom where I rencountered with
James More. He read the note scrupulously through like a
chapter in his Bible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;ye come a wee thing ahint-hand, Mr.
Balfour. The bird&rsquo;s flown&mdash;we hae letten her out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Drummond is set free?&rdquo; I cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Achy!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What would we keep her for, ye
ken? To hae made a steer about the bairn would hae
pleased naebody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where&rsquo;ll she be now?&rdquo; says I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gude kens!&rdquo; says Doig, with a shrug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have gone home to Lady Allardyce, I&rsquo;m thinking,&rdquo;
said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be it,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll gang there straight,&rdquo; says I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page180"></a>180</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But ye&rsquo;ll be for a bite or ye go?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither bite nor sup,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I had a good waucht
of milk in by Ratho.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aweel, aweel,&rdquo; says Doig. &ldquo;But ye&rsquo;ll can leave your
horse here and your bags, for it seems we&rsquo;re to have your
up-put.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Na, na,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Tamson&rsquo;s mear<a name="FnAnchor_17" href="#Footnote_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a> would never be
the thing for me this day of all days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doig speaking somewhat broad, I had been led by imitation
into an accent much more countrified than I was usually
careful to affect&mdash;a good deal broader indeed than I have
written it down; and I was the more ashamed when another
voice joined in behind me with a scrap of a ballad:</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;Gae saddle me the bonny black,</p>
  <p class="i2">Gae saddle sune, and mak&rsquo; him ready,</p>
<p class="i05">For I will down the Gatehope-slack,</p>
  <p class="i2">An&rsquo; a&rsquo; to see my bonny leddy.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The young lady, when I turned to her, stood in a morning
gown, and her hands muffled in the same, as if to hold me
at a distance. Yet I could not but think there was kindness
in the eye with which she saw me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My best respects to you, Mistress Grant,&rdquo; said I,
bowing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The like to yourself, Mr. David,&rdquo; she replied, with a
deep curtsy. &ldquo;And I beg to remind you of an old musty
saw, that meat and mass never hindered man. The mass I
cannot afford you, for we are all good Protestants. But the
meat I press on your attention. And I would not wonder
but I could find something for your private ear that would
be worth the stopping for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mistress Grant,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I believe I am already your
debtor for some merry words&mdash;and I think they were kind
too&mdash;on a piece of unsigned paper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unsigned paper?&rdquo; says she, and made a droll face,
which was likewise wondrous beautiful, as of one trying to
remember.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page181"></a>181</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Or else I am the more deceived,&rdquo; I went on. &ldquo;But
to be sure, we shall have the time to speak of these, since
your father is so good as to make me for a while your inmate;
and the <i>gomeril</i> begs you at this time only for the
favour of his liberty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You give yourself hard names,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Doig and I would be blithe to take harder at your
clever pen,&rdquo; says I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once more I have to admire the discretion of all menfolk,&rdquo;
she replied. &ldquo;But if you will not eat, off with you at
once; you will be back the sooner, for you go on a fool&rsquo;s
errand. Off with you, Mr. David,&rdquo; she continued, opening
the door.</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;He has lowpen on his bonny grey,</p>
  <p class="i2">He rade the richt gate and the ready;</p>
<p class="i05">I trow he would neither stint nor stay,</p>
  <p class="i2">For he was seeking his bonny leddy.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>I did not wait to be twice bidden, and did justice to Miss
Grant&rsquo;s citation on the way to Dean.</p>

<p>Old Lady Allardyce walked there alone in the garden,
in her hat and mutch, and having a silver-mounted staff of
some black wood to lean upon. As I alighted from my
horse, and drew near to her with <i>congees</i>, I could see the
blood come in her face, and her head fling into the air like
what I had conceived of empresses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What brings you to my poor door?&rdquo; she cried, speaking
high through her nose. &ldquo;I cannot bar it. The males
of my house are dead and buried; I have neither son nor
husband to stand in the gate for me; any beggar can pluck
me by the baird<a name="FnAnchor_18" href="#Footnote_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a>&mdash;and a baird there is, and that&rsquo;s the worst
of it yet!&rdquo; she added, partly to herself.</p>

<p>I was extremely put out at this reception, and the last
remark, which seemed like a daft wife&rsquo;s, left me near-hand
speechless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see I have fallen under your displeasure, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
said I. &ldquo;Yet I will still be so bold as to ask after Mistress
Drummond.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page182"></a>182</span></p>

<p>She considered me with a burning eye, her lips pressed
close together into twenty creases, her hand shaking on her
staff. &ldquo;This cowes all!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Ye come to me to
speir for her? Would God I knew!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is not here?&rdquo; I cried.</p>

<p>She threw up her chin and made a step and a cry at me,
so that I fell back incontinent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out upon your leeing throat!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;What!
ye come and speir at me! She&rsquo;s in jyle, whaur ye took her
to&mdash;that&rsquo;s all there is to it. And of a&rsquo; the beings ever I
beheld in breeks, to think it should be you! Ye timmer
scoun&rsquo;rel, if I had a male left to my name I would have your
jaicket dustit till ye raired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought it not good to delay longer in that place,
because I remarked her passion to be rising. As I turned to
the horse-post she even followed me; and I make no shame
to confess that I rode away with the one stirrup on and
scrambling for the other.</p>

<p>As I knew no other quarter where I could push my inquiries,
there was nothing left me but to return to the
Advocate&rsquo;s. I was well received by the four ladies, who
were now in company together, and must give the news of
Prestongrange and what word went in the west country, at
the most inordinate length and with great weariness to
myself; while all the time that young lady, with whom I so
much desired to be alone again, observed me quizzically,
and seemed to find pleasure in the sight of my impatience.
At last, after I had endured a meal with them, and was come
very near the point of appealing for an interview before her
aunt, she went and stood by the music-case, and picking
out a tune, sang to it on a high key&mdash;&ldquo;He that will not
when he may, When he will he shall have nay.&rdquo; But this
was the end of her rigours, and presently, after making some
excuse of which I have no mind, she carried me away in
private to her father&rsquo;s library. I should not fail to say that
she was dressed to the nines, and appeared extraordinary
handsome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page183"></a>183</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. David, sit ye down here, and let us have a
two-handed crack,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;For I have much to tell
you, and it appears besides that I have been grossly unjust
to your good taste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In what manner, Mistress Grant?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I trust
I have never seemed to fail in due respect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will be your surety, Mr. David,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Your
respect, whether to yourself or your poor neighbours, has
been always and most fortunately beyond imitation. But
that is by the question.&mdash;You got a note from me?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was so bold as to suppose so upon inference,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;and it was kindly thought upon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must have prodigiously surprised you,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;But let us begin with the beginning. You have not
perhaps forgot a day when you were so kind as to escort
three very tedious misses to Hope Park? I have the less
cause to forget it myself, because you were so particular
obliging as to introduce me to some of the principles of
the Latin grammar, a thing which wrote itself profoundly
on my gratitude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear I was sadly pedantical,&rdquo; said I, overcome with
confusion at the memory. &ldquo;You are only to consider I am
quite unused with the society of ladies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will say the less about the grammar then,&rdquo; she replied.
&ldquo;But how came you to desert your charge? &lsquo;He
has thrown her out, overboard, his ain, dear Annie!&rsquo;&rdquo; she
hummed; &ldquo;and his ain dear Annie and her two sisters had
to taigle home by theirselves like a string of green geese! It
seems you returned to my papa&rsquo;s, where you showed yourself
excessively martial, and then on to realms unknown,
with an eye (it appears) to the Bass Rock; solan geese being
perhaps more to your mind than bonny lasses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Through all this raillery there was something indulgent
in the lady&rsquo;s eye which made me suppose there might be
better coming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You take a pleasure to torment me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184"></a>184</span>
make a very feckless plaything; but let me ask you to be
more merciful. At this time there is but the one thing that
I care to hear of, and that will be news of Catriona.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you call her by that name to her face, Mr. Balfour?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In troth, and I am not very sure,&rdquo; I stammered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not do so in any case to strangers,&rdquo; said Miss
Grant.&mdash;&ldquo;And why are you so much immersed in the affairs
of this young lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard she was in prison,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and now you hear that she is out of it,&rdquo; she replied,
&ldquo;and what more would you have? She has no need
of any further champion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may have the greater need of her, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, this is better!&rdquo; says Miss Grant. &ldquo;But look
me fairly in the face; am I not bonnier than she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would be the last to be denying it,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;There
is not your marrow in all Scotland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, here you have the pick of the two at your hand,
and must needs speak of the other,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;This is
never the way to please the ladies, Mr. Balfour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, mistress,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there are surely other things
besides mere beauty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By which I am to understand that I am no better than
I should be, perhaps?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By which you will please understand that I am like the
cock in the midden in the fable-book,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I see the
braw jewel&mdash;and I like fine to see it too&mdash;but I have more
need of the pickle corn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bravissimo!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;There is a word well said
at last, and I will reward you for it with my story. That
same night of your desertion I came late from a friend&rsquo;s
house&mdash;where I was excessively admired, whatever you may
think of it&mdash;and what should I hear but that a lass in a
tartan screen desired to speak with me? She had been there
an hour or better, said the servant-lass, and she grat in to
herself as she sat waiting. I went to her direct; she rose as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185"></a>185</span>
I came in, and I knew her at a look. (&rsquo;<i>Grey Eyes</i>!&rsquo; says I
to myself, but was more wise than to let on.) <i>You will be
Miss Grant at last</i>? she says, rising and looking at me hard
and pitiful. <i>Ay, it was true he said, you are bonny, at all
events</i>.&mdash;<i>The way God made me, my dear</i>, I said, <i>but I would
be geyan obliged if ye could tell me what brought you here at such
a time of the night</i>.&mdash;<i>Lady</i>, she said, <i>we are kinsfolk, we are both
come of the blood of the sons of Alpin</i>.&mdash;<i>My dear</i>, I replied, <i>I
think no more of Alpin or his sons than what I do of a kale-stock.
You have a better argument in these tears upon your
bonny face</i>. And at that I was so weak-minded as to kiss
her, which is what you would like to do dearly, and I wager
will never find the courage of. I say it was weak-minded of
me, for I knew no more of her than the outside; but it was
the wisest stroke I could have hit upon. She is a very
staunch, brave nature, but I think she has been little used
with tenderness; and at that caress (though to say the
truth, it was but lightly given) her heart went out to me. I
will never betray the secrets of my sex, Mr. Davie; I will
never tell you the way she turned me round her thumb, because
it is the same she will use to twist yourself. Ay, it is a
fine lass! She is as clean as hill well-water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is e&rsquo;en &rsquo;t!&rdquo; I cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, she told me her concerns,&rdquo; pursued Miss
Grant, &ldquo;and in what a swither she was in about her papa,
and what a taking about yourself, with very little cause, and
in what a perplexity she had found herself after you was
gone away. <i>And then I minded at long last</i>, says she, <i>that
we were kinswomen, and that Mr. David should have given
you the name of the bonniest of the bonny, and I was thinking
to myself, &lsquo;If she is so bonny she will be good, at all events&rsquo;;
and I took up my foot-soles out of that</i>. That was when I
forgave yourself, Mr. Davie. When you was in my society,
you seemed upon hot iron: by all marks, if ever I saw a
young man that wanted to be gone, it was yourself, and I
and my two sisters were the ladies you were so desirous to
be gone from; and now it appeared you had given me some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186"></a>186</span>
notice in the bygoing, and was so kind as to comment on
my attractions! From that hour you may date our friendship,
and I began to think with tenderness upon the Latin
grammar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will have many hours to rally me in,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;and I think besides you do yourself injustice. I think it
was Catriona turned your heart in my direction. She is too
simple to perceive as you do the stiffness of her friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not like to wager upon that, Mr. David,&rdquo; said
she. &ldquo;The lasses have clear eyes. But at least she is your
friend entirely, as I was to see. I carried her in to his lordship,
my papa; and his Advocacy, being in a favourable
stage of claret, was so good as to receive the pair of us. <i>Here
is Grey Eyes that you have been deaved with these days past</i>,
said I; <i>she is come to prove that we spoke true, and I lay the
prettiest lass in the three Lothians at your feet</i>&mdash;making a
papistical reservation of myself. She suited her action to
my words: down she went upon her knees to him&mdash;I would
not like to swear but he saw two of her, which doubtless
made her appeal the more irresistible, for you are all a pack
of Mahomedans&mdash;told him what had passed that night,
and how she had withheld her father&rsquo;s man from following
of you, and what a case she was in about her father, and
what a flutter for yourself; and begged with weeping for the
lives of both of you (neither of which was in the slightest
danger), till I vow I was proud of my sex because it was done
so pretty, and ashamed for it because of the smallness of the
occasion. She had not gone far, I assure you, before the
Advocate was wholly sober, to see his inmost politics ravelled
out by a young lass and discovered to the most unruly of his
daughters. But we took him in hand, the pair of us, and
brought that matter straight. Properly managed&mdash;and
that means managed by me&mdash;there is no one to compare
with my papa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has been a good man to me,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he was a good man to Katrine, and I was there
to see to it,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page187"></a>187</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And she pled for me!&rdquo; says I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did that, and very movingly,&rdquo; said Miss Grant.
&ldquo;I would not like to tell you what she said&mdash;I find you vain
enough already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God reward her for it!&rdquo; cried I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With Mr. David Balfour, I suppose?&rdquo; says she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do me too much injustice at the last!&rdquo; I cried.
&ldquo;I would tremble to think of her in such hard hands. Do
you think I would presume, because she begged my life?
She would do that for a new-whelped puppy! I have had
more than that to set me up, if you but kenned. She
kissed that hand of mine. Ay, but she did. And why?
because she thought I was playing a brave part, and might
be going to my death. It was not for my sake&mdash;but I need
not be telling that to you, that cannot look at me without
laughter. It was for the love of what she thought was
bravery. I believe there is none but me and poor Prince
Charlie had that honour done them. Was this not to make
a god of me? and do you not think my heart would quake
when I remember it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do laugh at you a good deal, and a good deal more
than is quite civil,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;but I will tell you one thing:
if you speak to her like that, you have some glimmerings of a
chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;I would never dare. I can speak to
you, Miss Grant, because it&rsquo;s a matter of indifference what
ye think of me. But her? no fear!&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you have the largest feet in all broad Scotland,&rdquo;
says she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Troth, they are no&rsquo; very small,&rdquo; said I, looking down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, poor Catriona!&rdquo; cries Miss Grant.</p>

<p>And I could but stare upon her; for though I now see
very well what she was driving at (and perhaps some justification
for the same), I was never swift at the uptake in
such flimsy talk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah well, Mr. David,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it goes sore against
my conscience, but I see I shall have to be your speaking-board.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188"></a>188</span>
She shall know you came to her straight upon the
news of her imprisonment; she shall know you would not
pause to eat; and of our conversation she shall hear just so
much as I think convenient for a maid of her age and inexperience.
Believe me, you will be in that way much better
served than you could serve yourself, for I will keep the big
feet out of the platter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know where she is, then?&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I do, Mr. David, and will never tell,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why that?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am a good friend, as you will soon
discover; and the chief of those that I am friend to is my
papa. I assure you, you will never heat nor melt me out of
that, so you may spare me your sheep&rsquo;s eyes; and adieu to
your David-Balfourship for the now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there is yet one thing more,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;There is
one thing that must be stopped, being mere ruin to herself,
and to me too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;be brief; I have spent half the day
on you already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lady Allardyce believes,&rdquo; I began&mdash;&ldquo;she supposes&mdash;she
thinks that I abducted her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The colour came into Miss Grant&rsquo;s face, so that at first I
was quite abashed to find her ear so delicate, till I bethought
me she was struggling rather with mirth, a notion in which
I was altogether confirmed by the shaking of her voice as she
replied&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will take up the defence of your reputation,&rdquo; said
she. &ldquo;You may leave it in my hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that she withdrew out of the library.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX</h3>

<h5>I CONTINUE TO MOVE IN GOOD SOCIETY</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">For</span> about exactly two months I remained a guest in Prestongrange&rsquo;s
family, where I bettered my acquaintance with
the Bench, the Bar, and the flower of Edinburgh company.
You are not to suppose my education was neglected; on the
contrary, I was kept extremely busy. I studied the French,
so as to be more prepared to go to Leyden; I set myself to
the fencing, and wrought hard, sometimes three hours in the
day, with notable advancement; at the suggestion of my
cousin Pilrig, who was an apt musician, I was put to a singing-class;
and by the orders of my Miss Grant, to one for the
dancing, at which I must say I proved far from ornamental.
However, all were good enough to say it gave me an address
a little more genteel; and there is no question but I learned
to manage my coat-skirts and sword with more dexterity,
and to stand in a room as though the same belonged to me.
My clothes themselves were all earnestly re-ordered; and
the most trifling circumstance, such as where I should tie my
hair, or the colour of my ribbon, debated among the three
misses like a thing of weight. One way with another, no
doubt I was a good deal improved to look at, and acquired a
bit of a modish air that would have surprised the good folks
at Essendean.</p>

<p>The two younger misses were very willing to discuss a
point of my habiliment, because that was in the line of their
chief thoughts. I cannot say that they appeared any other
way conscious of my presence; and though always more
than civil, with a kind of heartless cordiality, could not
hide how much I wearied them. As for the aunt, she was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190"></a>190</span>
wonderful still woman; and I think she gave me much the
same attention as she gave the rest of the family, which was
little enough. The eldest daughter and the Advocate himself
were thus my principal friends, and our familiarity was
much increased by a pleasure that we took in common.
Before the court met we spent a day or two at the house of
Grange, living very nobly with an open table, and here it was
that we three began to ride out together in the fields, a
practice afterwards maintained in Edinburgh, so far as the
Advocate&rsquo;s continual affairs permitted. When we were put
in a good frame by the briskness of the exercise, the difficulties
of the way, or the accidents of bad weather, my shyness
wore entirely off; we forgot that we were strangers,
and speech not being required, it flowed the more naturally
on. Then it was that they had my story from me, bit by
bit, from the time that I left Essendean, with my voyage
and battle in the <i>Covenant</i>, wanderings in the heather, etc.;
and from the interest they found in my adventures sprung
the circumstance of a jaunt we made a little later on, on a
day when the courts were not sitting, and of which I will tell
a trifle more at length.</p>

<p>We took horse early, and passed first by the house of
Shaws, where it stood smokeless in a great field of white
frost, for it was yet early in the day. Here Prestongrange
alighted down, gave me his horse, and proceeded alone to
visit my uncle. My heart, I remember, swelled up bitter
within me at the sight of that bare house and the thought of
the old miser sitting chittering within in the cold kitchen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is my home,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and my family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor David Balfour!&rdquo; said Miss Grant.</p>

<p>What passed during the visit I have never heard; but it
would doubtless not be very agreeable to Ebenezer, for when
the Advocate came forth again his face was dark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you will soon be the laird indeed, Mr. Davie,&rdquo;
says he, turning half about with the one foot in the stirrup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will never pretend sorrow,&rdquo; said I; and, to say the
truth, during his absence Miss Grant and I had been embellishing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191"></a>191</span>
the place in fancy with plantations, parterres, and
a terrace&mdash;much as I have since carried out in fact.</p>

<p>Thence we pushed to the Queen&rsquo;s Ferry, where Rankeillor
gave us a good welcome, being indeed out of the
body to receive so great a visitor. Here the Advocate was
so unaffectedly good as to go quite fully over my affairs,
sitting perhaps two hours with the Writer in his study, and
expressing (I was told) a great esteem for myself and concern
for my fortunes. To while this time, Miss Grant and I and
young Rankeillor took boat and passed the Hope to Limekilns.
Rankeillor made himself very ridiculous (and, I
thought, offensive) with his admiration for the young lady,
and to my wonder (only it is so common a weakness of her
sex) she seemed, if anything, to be a little gratified. One use
it had: for when we were come to the other side, she laid her
commands on him to mind the boat, while she and I passed a
little farther to the alehouse. This was her own thought,
for she had been taken with my account of Alison Hastie,
and desired to see the lass herself. We found her once more
alone&mdash;indeed, I believe her father wrought all day in the
fields&mdash;and she curtsied dutifully to the gentry-folk and the
beautiful young lady in the riding-coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this all the welcome I am to get?&rdquo; said I, holding
out my hand. &ldquo;And have you no more memory of old
friends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep me! wha&rsquo;s this of it?&rdquo; she cried, and then,
&ldquo;God&rsquo;s truth, it&rsquo;s the tautit<a name="FnAnchor_19" href="#Footnote_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a> laddie!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very same,&rdquo; says I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mony&rsquo;s the time I&rsquo;ve thocht upon you and your freen,
and blithe am I to see you in your braws,&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_20" href="#Footnote_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a> she cried;
&ldquo;though I kennt ye were come to your ain folk by the grand
present that ye sent me, and that I thank ye for with a&rsquo; my
heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Miss Grant to me, &ldquo;run out by with ye,
like a good bairn, I didna come here to stand and baud a
candle; it&rsquo;s her and me that are to crack.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page192"></a>192</span></p>

<p>I suppose she stayed ten minutes in the house, but when
she came forth I observed two things&mdash;that her eyes were
reddened, and a silver brooch was gone out of her bosom.
This very much affected me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never saw you so well adorned,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, Davie man, dinna be a pompous gowk!&rdquo; said she,
and was more than usually sharp to me the remainder of the
day.</p>

<p>About candlelight we came home from this excursion.</p>

<p>For a good while I heard nothing further of Catriona&mdash;my
Miss Grant remaining quite impenetrable, and stopping
my mouth with pleasantries. At last, one day that she
returned from walking, and found me alone in the parlour
over my French, I thought there was something unusual in
her looks; the colour heightened, the eyes sparkling high,
and a bit of a smile continually bitten in as she regarded me.
She seemed indeed like the very spirit of mischief, and, walking
briskly in the room, had soon involved me in a kind of
quarrel over nothing and (at the least) with nothing intended
on my side. I was like Christian in the slough&mdash;the more I
tried to clamber out upon the side, the deeper I became involved;
until at last I heard her declare, with a great deal
of passion, that she would take that answer at the hands of
none, and I must down upon my knees for pardon.</p>

<p>The causelessness of all this fuff stirred my own bile. &ldquo;I
have said nothing you can properly object to,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and
as for my knees, that is an attitude I keep for God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And as a goddess I am to be served!&rdquo; she cried, shaking
her brown locks at me and with a bright colour. &ldquo;Every
man that comes within waft of my petticoats shall use
me so!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go so far as ask your pardon for the fashion&rsquo;s sake,
although I vow I know not why,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;But for these
play-acting postures, you can go to others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Davie!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Not if I was to beg
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I bethought me I was fighting with a woman, which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193"></a>193</span>
the same as to say a child, and that upon a point entirely
formal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it a bairnly thing,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;not worthy in
you to ask, or me to render. Yet I will not refuse you,
neither,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and the stain, if there be any, rests with
yourself.&rdquo; And at that I kneeled fairly down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;There is the proper station,
there is where I have been man&oelig;uvring to bring you.&rdquo; And
then, suddenly, &ldquo;Kep,&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_21" href="#Footnote_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a> said she, flung me a folded billet,
and ran from the apartment laughing.</p>

<p>The billet had neither place nor date. &ldquo;Dear Mr.
David,&rdquo; it began, &ldquo;I get your news continually by my
cousin, Miss Grant, and it is a pleisand hearing. I am very
well, in a good place, among good folk, but necessitated to be
quite private, though I am hoping that at long last we may
meet again. All your friendships have been told me by my
loving cousin, who loves us both. She bids me to send you
this writing, and oversees the same. I will be asking you to
do all her commands, and rest your affectionate friend,
Catriona Macgregor-Drummond. <i>P.S.</i>&mdash;Will you not see
my cousin, Allardyce?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I think it not the least brave of my campaigns (as the
soldiers say) that I should have done as I was here bidden
and gone forthright to the house by Dean. But the old lady
was now entirely changed, and supple as a glove. By what
means Miss Grant had brought this round I could never
guess; I am sure, at least, she dared not to appear openly in
the affair, for her papa was compromised in it pretty deep.
It was he, indeed, who had persuaded Catriona to leave, or
rather, not to return to, her cousin&rsquo;s, placing her instead
with a family of Gregorys&mdash;decent people, quite at the
Advocate&rsquo;s disposition, and in whom she might have the
more confidence because they were of her own clan and
family. These kept her private till all was ripe, heated and
helped her to attempt her father&rsquo;s rescue, and after she was
discharged from prison received her again into the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194"></a>194</span>
secrecy. Thus Prestongrange obtained and used his instrument;
nor did there leak out the smallest word of his acquaintance
with the daughter of James More. There was
some whispering, of course, upon the escape of that discredited
person; but the Government replied by a show of
rigour, one of the cell-porters was flogged, the lieutenant of
the guard (my poor friend, Duncansby) was broken of his
rank, and as for Catriona, all men were well enough pleased
that her fault should be passed by in silence.</p>

<p>I could never induce Miss Grant to carry back an answer.
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she would say, when I persisted, &ldquo;I am going to keep
the big feet out of the platter.&rdquo; This was the more hard to
bear, as I was aware she saw my little friend many times in
the week, and carried her my news whenever (as she said) I
&ldquo;had behaved myself.&rdquo; At last she treated me to what she
called an indulgence, and I thought rather more of a banter.
She was certainly a strong, almost a violent, friend to all
she liked, chief among whom was a certain frail old gentlewoman,
very blind and very witty, who dwelt in the top of a
tall land on a strait close, with a nest of linnets in a cage,
and thronged all day with visitors. Miss Grant was very
fond to carry me there and put me to entertain her friend
with the narrative of my misfortunes; and Miss Tibbie
Ramsay (that was her name) was particular kind, and told
me a great deal that was worth knowledge of old folks
and past affairs in Scotland. I should say that from her
chamber-window, and not three feet away, such is the straitness
of that close, it was possible to look into a barred loophole
lighting the stairway of the opposite house.</p>

<p>Here, upon some pretext, Miss Grant left me one day
alone with Miss Ramsay. I mind I thought that lady inattentive
and like one pre-occupied. It was besides very
uncomfortable, for the window, contrary to custom, was left
open, and the day was cold. All at once the voice of Miss
Grant sounded in my ears as from a distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, Shaws!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;keek out of the window and
see what I have broughten you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page195"></a>195</span></p>

<p>I think it was the prettiest sight that ever I beheld. The
well of the close was all in clear shadow where a man could
see distinctly, the walls very black and dingy; and there
from the barred loophole I saw two faces smiling across at
me&mdash;Miss Grant&rsquo;s and Catriona&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; says Miss Grant, &ldquo;I wanted her to see you in
your braws, like the lass of Limekilns. I wanted her to see
what I could make of you, when I buckled to the job in
earnest!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It came in my mind she had been more than common
particular that day upon my dress: and I think that some
of the same care had been bestowed upon Catriona. For so
merry and sensible a lady, Miss Grant was certainly wonderful
taken up with duds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catriona!&rdquo; was all I could get out.</p>

<p>As for her, she said nothing in the world, but only waved
her hand and smiled to me, and was suddenly carried away
again from before the loophole.</p>

<p>That vision was no sooner lost than I ran to the house-door,
where I found I was locked in; thence back to Miss
Ramsay, crying for the key, but might as well have cried
upon the Castle rock. She had passed her word, she said,
and I must be a good lad. It was impossible to burst the
door, even if it had been mannerly; it was impossible I
should leap from the window, being seven stories above
ground. All I could do was to crane over the close and
watch for their reappearance from the stair. It was little
to see, being no more than the tops of their two heads, each
on a ridiculous bobbin of skirts, like to a pair of pincushions.
Nor did Catriona so much as look up for a farewell; being
prevented (as I heard afterwards) by Miss Grant, who told
her folk were never seen to less advantage than from above
downward.</p>

<p>On the way home, as soon as I was free, I upbraided Miss
Grant for her cruelty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry you was disappointed,&rdquo; says she demurely.
&ldquo;For my part I was very pleased. You looked better than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196"></a>196</span>
I dreaded; you looked&mdash;if it will not make you vain&mdash;a
mighty pretty young man when you appeared in the window.
You are to remember that she could not see your feet,&rdquo; says
she, with the manner of one reassuring me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O!&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;leave my feet be&mdash;they are no bigger
than my neighbours&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are even smaller than some,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but I
speak in parables, like a Hebrew prophet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I marvel little they were sometimes stoned!&rdquo; says I.
&ldquo;But, you miserable girl, how could you do it? Why
should you care to tantalise me with a moment?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Love is like folk,&rdquo; says she; &ldquo;it needs some kind of
vivers.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_22" href="#Footnote_22"><span class="sp">22</span></a></p>

<p>&ldquo;O, Barbara, let me see her properly!&rdquo; I pleaded.
&ldquo;You can&mdash;you see her when you please; let me have half
an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it that is managing this love-affair? You?
Or me?&rdquo; she asked, and, as I continued to press her with
my instances, fell back upon a deadly expedient: that of
imitating the tones of my voice when I called on Catriona by
name; with which, indeed, she held me in subjection for
some days to follow.</p>

<p>There was never the least word heard of the memorial,
or none by me. Prestongrange and his Grace the Lord
President may have heard of it (for what I know) on the
deafest sides of their heads; they kept it to themselves at
least&mdash;the public was none the wiser; and in course of time,
on November 8th, and in the midst of a prodigious storm of
wind and rain, poor James of the Glens was duly hanged at
Lettermore by Balachulish.</p>

<p>So there was the final upshot of my politics! Innocent
men have perished before James, and are like to keep on
perishing (in spite of all our wisdom) till the end of time.
And till the end of time young folk (who are not yet used
with the duplicity of life and men) will struggle as I did, and
make heroical resolves, and take long risks; and the course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197"></a>197</span>
of events will push them upon the one side and go on like
a marching army. James was hanged; and here was I,
dwelling in the house of Prestongrange, and grateful to him
for his fatherly attention. He was hanged; and behold!
when I met Mr. Simon in the causeway, I was fain to pull off
my beaver to him like a good little boy before his dominie.
He had been hanged by fraud and violence, and the world
wagged along, and there was not a pennyweight of difference;
and the villains of that horrid plot were decent, kind,
respectable fathers of families, who went to kirk and took
the sacrament!</p>

<p>But I had had my view of that detestable business they
call politics&mdash;I had seen it from behind, when it is all bones
and blackness; and I was cured for life of any temptations
to take part in it again. A plain, quiet, private path was that
which I was ambitious to walk in, where I might keep my
head out of the way of dangers and my conscience out of the
road of temptation. For, upon a retrospect, it appeared I
had not done so grandly, after all; but, with the greatest
possible amount of big speech and preparation, had accomplished
nothing.</p>

<p>The 25th of the same month a ship was advertised to sail
from Leith; and I was suddenly recommended to make up
my mails for Leyden. To Prestongrange I could, of course,
say nothing; for I had already been a long while sorning on
his house and table. But with his daughter I was more
open, bewailing my fate that I should be sent out of
the country, and assuring her, unless she should bring
me to farewell with Catriona, I would refuse at the last
hour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I not given you my advice?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you have,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I know how much I
am beholden to you already, and that I am bidden to obey
your orders. But you must confess you are something too
merry a lass at times to lippen to<a name="FnAnchor_23" href="#Footnote_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a> entirely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you, then,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Be you on board by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198"></a>198</span>
nine o&rsquo;clock forenoon; the ship does not sail before one;
keep your boat alongside; and if you are not pleased with
my farewells when I shall send them, you can come ashore
again and seek Katrine for yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Since I could make no more of her, I was fain to be content
with this.</p>

<p>The day came round at last when she and I were to separate.
We had been extremely intimate and familiar; I
was much in her debt; and what way we were to part was a
thing that put me from my sleep, like the vails I was to give
to the domestic servants. I knew she considered me too
backward, and rather desired to rise in her opinion on that
head. Besides which, after so much affection shown and (I
believe) felt upon both sides, it would have looked cold-like
to be anyways stiff. Accordingly, I got my courage up and
my words ready, and the last chance we were like to be
alone, asked pretty boldly to be allowed to salute her in
farewell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You forget yourself strangely, Mr. Balfour,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;I cannot call to mind that I have given you any right to
presume on our acquaintancy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I stood before her like a stopped clock, and knew not
what to think, far less to say, when of a sudden she cast her
arms about my neck and kissed me with the best will in the
world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You inimitable bairn!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Did you think
that I would let us part like strangers? Because I can never
keep my gravity at you five minutes on end, you must not
dream I do not love you very well: I am all love and
laughter, every time I cast an eye on you! And now I will
give you an advice to conclude your education, which you
will have need of before it&rsquo;s very long. Never <i>ask</i> women-folk.
They are bound to answer &lsquo;No&rsquo;; God never made
the lass that could resist the temptation. It&rsquo;s supposed by
divines to be the curse of Eve: because she did not say it
when the devil offered her the apple, her daughters can say
nothing else.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page199"></a>199</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Since I am so soon to lose my bonny professor,&rdquo; I
began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is gallant, indeed,&rdquo; says she, curtsying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;I would put the one question,&rdquo; I went on: &ldquo;May I
ask a lass to marry me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think you could not marry her without?&rdquo; she
asked. &ldquo;Or else get her to offer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see you cannot be serious,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be very serious in one thing, David,&rdquo; said she:
&ldquo;I shall always be your friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I got to my horse the next morning, the four ladies
were all at the same window whence we had once looked
down on Catriona, and all cried farewell and waved their
pocket-napkins as I rode away. One out of the four I knew
was truly sorry; and at the thought of that, and how I had
come to the door three months ago for the first time, sorrow
and gratitude made a confusion in my mind.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI</h3>

<h5>THE VOYAGE INTO HOLLAND</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> ship lay at a single anchor, well outside the pier of
Leith, so that all we passengers must come to it by the means
of skiffs. This was very little troublesome, for the reason
that the day was a flat calm, very frosty and cloudy, and
with a low shifting fog upon the water. The body of the
vessel was thus quite hid as I drew near, but the tall spars
of her stood high and bright in a sunshine like the flickering
of a fire. She proved to be a very roomy, commodious
merchant, but somewhat blunt in the bows, and loaden extraordinary
deep with salt, salted salmon, and fine white
linen stockings for the Dutch. Upon my coming on board,
the captain welcomed me&mdash;one Sang (out of Lesmahago, I
believe), a very hearty, friendly tarpaulin of a man, but at
the moment in rather of a bustle. There had no other of the
passengers yet appeared, so that I was left to walk about
upon the deck, viewing the prospect and wondering a good
deal what these farewells should be which I was promised.</p>

<p>All Edinburgh and the Pentland Hills glinted above me
in a kind of smuisty brightness, now and again overcome
with blots of cloud; of Leith there was no more than the
tops of chimneys visible, and on the face of the water, where
the haar<a name="FnAnchor_24" href="#Footnote_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a> lay, nothing at all. Out of this I was presently
aware of a sound of oars pulling, and a little after (as if out
of the smoke of a fire) a boat issued. There sat a grave man
in the stern-sheets, well muffled from the cold, and by his
side a tall, pretty, tender figure of a maid that brought my
heart to a stand. I had scarce the time to catch my breath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204"></a>204</span>
in, and be ready to meet her, as she stepped upon the deck,
smiling, and making my best bow, which was now vastly
finer than some months before, when first I made it to her
ladyship. No doubt we were both a good deal changed:
she seemed to have shot up taller, like a young, comely tree.
She had now a kind of pretty backwardness that became her
well, as of one that regarded herself more highly, and was
fairly woman; and for another thing, the hand of the same
magician had been at work upon the pair of us, and Miss
Grant had made us both <i>braw</i>, if she could make but the one
<i>bonny</i>.</p>

<p>The same cry, in words not very different, came from
both of us, that the other was come in compliment to say
farewell, and then we perceived in a flash we were to ship
together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, why will not Baby have been telling me!&rdquo; she cried;
and then remembered a letter she had been given, on the condition
of not opening it till she was well on board. Within
was an enclosure for myself, and ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Dear Davie</span>,&mdash;What do you think of my farewell? and what
do you say to your fellow-passenger? Did you kiss, or did you ask?
I was about to have signed here, but that would leave the purport
of my question doubtful; and in my own case <i>I ken the answer</i>. So
fill up here with good advice. Do not be too blate,<a name="FnAnchor_25" href="#Footnote_25"><span class="sp">25</span></a> and for God&rsquo;s
sake do not try to be too forward; nothing sets you worse.&mdash;I am</p>

<p style="padding-left: 5em;">&ldquo;Your affectionate friend and governess,</p>

    <p class="rt">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Barbara Grant</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>I wrote a word of answer and compliment on a leaf out
of my pocket-book, put it in with another scratch from
Catriona, sealed the whole with my new signet of the Balfour
arms, and despatched it by the hand of Prestongrange&rsquo;s
servant, that still waited in my boat.</p>

<p>Then we had time to look upon each other more at leisure,
which we had not done for a piece of a minute before (upon
a common impulse) we shook hands again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catriona!&rdquo; said I. It seemed that was the first and
last word of my eloquence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page205"></a>205</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be glad to see me again?&rdquo; says she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I think that is an idle word,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;We are too
deep friends to make speech upon such trifles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she not the girl of all the world?&rdquo; she cried again.
&ldquo;I was never knowing such a girl, so honest and so beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet she cared no more for Alpin than what she did
for a kale-stock,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, she will say so indeed!&rdquo; cries Catriona. &ldquo;Yet
it was for the name and the gentle kind blood that she took
me up and was so good to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I will tell you why it was,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;There are
all sorts of people&rsquo;s faces in this world. There is Barbara&rsquo;s
face, that every one must look at and admire, and think her
a fine, brave, merry girl. And then there is your face, which
is quite different&mdash;I never knew how different till to-day.
You cannot see yourself, and that is why you do not understand
but it was for the love of your face that she took you
up and was so good to you. And everybody in the world
would do the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody?&rdquo; says she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every living soul!&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, then, that will be why the soldiers at the Castle
took me up!&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Barbara has been teaching you to catch me,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will have taught me more than that, at all events.
She will have taught me a great deal about Mr. David&mdash;-all
the ill of him, and a little that was not so ill either, now and
then,&rdquo; she said, smiling. &ldquo;She will have told me all there
was of Mr. David, only just that he would sail upon this very
same ship. And why it is you go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;we will be some days in company,
and then (I suppose) good-bye for altogether! I go
to meet my father at a place of the name of Helvoetsluys,
and from there to France, to be exiles by the side of our
chieftain.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page206"></a>206</span></p>

<p>I could say no more than just &ldquo;O!&rdquo; the name of James
More always drying up my very voice.</p>

<p>She was quick to perceive it, and to guess some portion
of my thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one thing I must be saying first of all, Mr.
David,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I think two of my kinsfolk have not
behaved to you altogether very well. And the one of them
two is James More, my father, and the other is the Laird of
Prestongrange. Prestongrange will have spoken by himself,
or his daughter in the place of him. But for James
More, my father, I have this much to say: he lay shackled
in a prison; he is a plain honest soldier and a plain Highland
gentleman; what they would be after he would never
be guessing; but if he had understood it was to be some
prejudice to a young gentleman like yourself, he would have
died first. And for the sake of all your friendships, I will be
asking you to pardon my father and family for that same
mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catriona,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what that mistake was I do not
care to know. I know but the one thing&mdash;that you went to
Prestongrange and begged my life upon your knees. O, I
ken well it was for your father that you went, but when you
were there you pleaded for me also. It is a thing I cannot
speak of. There are two things I cannot think of in to
myself: and the one is your good words when you called
yourself my little friend, and the other that you pleaded for
my life. Let us never speak more, we two, of pardon or
offence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We stood after that silent, Catriona looking on the deck
and I on her; and before there was more speech, a little wind
having sprung up in the nor&rsquo;-west, they began to shake out
the sails and heave in upon the anchor.</p>

<p>There were six passengers besides our two selves, which
made of it a full cabin. Three were solid merchants out of
Leith, Kirkcaldy, and Dundee, all engaged in the same adventure
into High Germany. One was a Hollander returning;
the rest worthy merchants&rsquo; wives, to the charge of one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207"></a>207</span>
of whom Catriona was recommended. Mrs. Gebbie (for
that was her name) was by great good fortune heavily incommoded
by the sea, and lay day and night on the broad
of her back. We were besides the only creatures at all
young on board the <i>Rose</i>, except a white-faced boy that did
my old duty to attend upon the table; and it came about
that Catriona and I were left almost entirely to ourselves.
We had the next seats together at the table, where I waited
on her with extraordinary pleasure. On deck, I made her a
soft place with my cloak; and the weather being singularly
fine for that season, with bright frosty days and nights, a
steady, gentle wind, and scarce a sheet started all the way
through the North Sea, we sat there (only now and again
walking to and fro for warmth) from the first blink of the
sun till eight or nine at night under the clear stars. The
merchants or Captain Sang would sometimes glance and
smile upon us, or pass a merry word or two and give us the
go-by again; but the most part of the time they were deep
in herring and chintzes and linen, or in computations of the
slowness of the passage, and left us to our own concerns,
which were very little important to any but ourselves.</p>

<p>At the first we had a great deal to say, and thought ourselves
pretty witty; and I was at a little pains to be the
<i>beau</i>, and she (I believe) to play the young lady of experience.
But soon we grew plainer with each other. I laid
aside my high, clipped English (what little there was of it)
and forgot to make my Edinburgh bows and scrapes; she,
upon her side, fell into a sort of kind familiarity; and we
dwelt together like those of the same household, only (upon
my side) with a more deep emotion. About the same time,
the bottom seemed to fall out of our conversation, and
neither one of us the less pleased. Whiles she would tell me
old wives&rsquo; tales, of which she had a wonderful variety, many
of them from my friend red-headed Neil. She told them very
pretty, and they were pretty enough childish tales; but the
pleasure to myself was in the sound of her voice, and the
thought that she was telling and I was listening. Whiles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208"></a>208</span>
again, we would sit entirely silent, not communicating even
with a look, and tasting pleasure enough in the sweetness of
that neighbourhood. I speak here only for myself. Of
what was in the maid&rsquo;s mind I am not very sure that ever I
asked myself; and what was in my own I was afraid to consider.
I need make no secret of it now, either to myself
or to the reader: I was fallen totally in love. She came
between me and the sun. She had grown suddenly taller, as
I say, but with a wholesome growth; she seemed all health,
and lightness, and brave spirits; and I thought she walked
like a young deer, and stood like a birch upon the mountains.
It was enough for me to sit near by her on the deck;
and I declare I scarce spent two thoughts upon the future,
and was so well content with what I then enjoyed that I
was never at the pains to imagine any further step; unless
perhaps that I would be sometimes tempted to take her hand
in mine and hold it there. But I was too like a miser of
what joys I had, and would venture nothing on a hazard.</p>

<p>What we spoke was usually of ourselves or of each
other, so that if any one had been at so much pains as overhear
us, he must have supposed us the most egotistical
persons in the world. It befell one day when we were at
this practice, that we came on a discourse of friends and
friendship, and I think now that we were sailing near the
wind. We said what a fine thing friendship was, and how
little we had guessed of it, and how it made life a new thing,
and a thousand covered things of the same kind that will
have been said, since the foundation of the world, by young
folk in the same predicament. Then we remarked upon the
strangeness of that circumstance, that friends came together
in the beginning as if they were there for the first time, and
yet each had been alive a good while, losing time with other
people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not much that I have done,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and I
could be telling you the five-fifths of it in two-three words.
It is only a girl I am, and what can befall a girl, at all events?
But I went with the clan in the year &rsquo;Forty-five. The men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209"></a>209</span>
marched with swords and firelocks, and some of them in
brigades in the same set of tartan; they were not backward
at the marching, I can tell you. And there were gentlemen
from the Low Country, with their tenants mounted and
trumpets to sound, and there was a grand skirling of war-pipes.
I rode on a little Highland horse on the right hand
of my father, James More, and of Glengyle himself. And
here is one fine thing that I remember, that Glengyle kissed
me in the face, because (says he) &lsquo;my kinswoman, you are
the only lady of the clan that has come out,&rsquo; and me a little
maid of maybe twelve years old! I saw Prince Charlie too,
and the blue eyes of him; he was pretty indeed! I had his
hand to kiss in the front of the army. O, well, these were
the good days, but it is all like a dream that I have seen and
then awakened. It went what way you very well know;
and these were the worst days of all, when the red-coat
soldiers were out, and my father and my uncles lay in the
hill, and I was to be carrying them their meat in the middle
night, or at the short side of day when the cocks crow. Yes,
I have walked in the night, many&rsquo;s the time, and my heart
great in me for terror of the darkness. It is a strange thing
I will never have been meddled with a bogle; but they say
a maid goes safe. Next there was my uncle&rsquo;s marriage,
and that was a dreadful affair beyond all. Jean Kay was
that woman&rsquo;s name; and she had me in the room with her
that night at Inversnaid, the night we took her from her
friends in the old, ancient manner. She would and she
wouldn&rsquo;t; she was for marrying Rob the one minute, and
the next she would be for none of him. I will never have
seen such a feckless creature of a woman; surely all there
was of her would tell her ay or no. Well, she was a widow,
and I can never be thinking a widow a good woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catriona!&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;how do you make out that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I am only telling you the
seeming in my heart. And then to marry a new man! Fy!
But that was her; and she was married again upon my
uncle Robin, and went with him a while to kirk and market;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210"></a>210</span>
and then wearied, or else her friends got claught of her and
talked her round, or maybe she turned ashamed; at the
least of it, she ran away, and went back to her own folk, and
said we had held her in the lake, and I will never tell you all
what. I have never thought much of any females since that
day. And so, in the end, my father, James More, came to
be cast in prison, and you know the rest of it as well as me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And through all you had no friends?&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I have been pretty chief with two-three
lasses on the braes, but not to call it friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, mine is a plain tale,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I never had a
friend to my name till I met in with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that brave Mr. Stewart?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, yes, I was forgetting him,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But he is a
man, and that is very different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would think so,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;O, yes, it is quite
different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then there was one other,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I once
thought I had a friend, but it proved a disappointment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She asked me who she was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a he, then,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;We were the two best lads
at my father&rsquo;s school, and we thought we loved each other
dearly. Well, the time came when he went to Glasgow, to
a merchant&rsquo;s house, that was his second cousin once removed;
and wrote me two-three times by the carrier; and
then he found new friends, and I might write till I was tired,
he took no notice. Eh, Catriona, it took me a long while to
forgive the world. There is not anything more bitter than
to lose a fancied friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she began to question me close upon his looks and
character, for we were each a great deal concerned in all that
touched the other; till at last, in a very evil hour, I minded
of his letters and went and fetched the bundle from the cabin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here are his letters,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and all the letters that
ever I got. That will be the last I&rsquo;ll can tell of myself; you
know the lave<a name="FnAnchor_26" href="#Footnote_26"><span class="sp">26</span></a> as well as I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page211"></a>211</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you let me read them, then?&rdquo; says she.</p>

<p>I told her, <i>if she would be at the pains</i>; and she bade me
go away and she would read them from the one end to the
other. Now, in this bundle that I gave her there were
packed together not only all the letters of my false friend,
but one or two of Mr. Campbell&rsquo;s when he was in town at the
Assembly, and to make a complete roll of all that ever was
written to me, Catriona&rsquo;s little word, and the two I had received
from Miss Grant, one when I was on the Bass, and one
on board that ship. But of these last I had no particular
mind at the moment.</p>

<p>I was in that state of subjection to the thought of my
friend that it mattered not what I did, nor scarce whether I
was in her presence or out of it; I had caught her like some
kind of a noble fever that lived continually in my bosom, by
night and by day, and whether I was waking or asleep. So
it befell that after I was come into the fore-part of the
ship, where the broad bows splashed into the billows, I was
in no such hurry to return, as you might fancy; rather
prolonged my absence like a variety in pleasure. I do not
think I am by nature much of an Epicurean; and there
had come till then so small a share of pleasure in my way
that I might be excused, perhaps, to dwell on it unduly.</p>

<p>When I returned to her again, I had a faint, painful
impression as of a buckle slipped, so coldly she returned the
packet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have read them?&rdquo; said I; and I thought my voice
sounded not wholly natural, for I was turning in my mind
for what could ail her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you mean me to read all?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>I told her &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; with a drooping voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The last of them as well?&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>I knew where we were now; yet I would not lie to her
either. &ldquo;I gave them all without afterthought,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;as I supposed that you would read them. I see no harm
in any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will be differently made,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I thank God
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212"></a>212</span>
I am differently made. It was not a fit letter to be shown
me. It was not fit to be written.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you are speaking of your own friend, Barbara
Grant?&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There will not be anything as bitter as to lose a fancied
friend,&rdquo; said she, quoting my own expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it is sometimes the friendship that was fancied!&rdquo;
I cried. &ldquo;What kind of justice do you call this, to blame
me for some words that a tomfool of a madcap lass has
written down upon a piece of paper? You know yourself
with what respect I have behaved&mdash;and would do always.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet you would show me that same letter!&rdquo; says she.
&ldquo;I want no such friends. I can be doing very well, Mr.
Balfour, without her&mdash;or you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is your fine gratitude!&rdquo; says I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very much obliged to you,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I will
be asking you to take away your&mdash;letters.&rdquo; She seemed to
choke upon the word, so that it sounded like an oath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall never ask twice,&rdquo; said I; picked up that
bundle, walked a little way forward and cast them as far as
possible into the sea. For a very little more I could have
cast myself after them.</p>

<p>The rest of the day I walked up and down raging. There
were few names so ill but what I gave her them in my own
mind before the sun went down. All that I had ever heard
of Highland pride seemed quite outdone; that a girl (scarce
grown) should resent so trifling an allusion, and that from
her next friend, that she had near wearied me with praising
of! I had bitter, sharp, hard thoughts of her, like an angry
boy&rsquo;s. If I had kissed her indeed (I thought), perhaps she
would have taken it pretty well; and only because it had
been written down, and with a spice of jocularity, up she
must fuff in this ridiculous passion. It seemed to me there
was a want of penetration in the female sex, to make angels
weep over the case of the poor men.</p>

<p>We were side by side again at supper, and what a change
was there! She was like curdled milk to me; her face was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213"></a>213</span>
like a wooden doll&rsquo;s; I could have indifferently smitten her
or grovelled at her feet, but she gave me not the least occasion
to do either. No sooner the meal done than she betook
herself to attend on Mrs. Gebbie, which I think she had a
little neglected heretofore. But she was to make up for lost
time, and in what remained of the passage was extraordinary
assiduous with the old lady, and on deck began to make a
great deal more than I thought wise of Captain Sang. Not
but what the captain seemed a worthy, fatherly man; but
I hated to behold her in the least familiarity with any one
except myself.</p>

<p>Altogether, she was so quick to avoid me, and so constant
to keep herself surrounded with others, that I must watch
a long while before I could find my opportunity; and after
it was found, I made not much of it, as you are now to hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no guess how I have offended,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;it
should scarce be beyond pardon, then. O, try if you can
pardon me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no pardon to give,&rdquo; said she; and the words
seemed to come out of her throat like marbles. &ldquo;I will be
very much obliged for all your friendships.&rdquo; And she made
me an eighth part of a curtsy.</p>

<p>But I had schooled myself beforehand to say more, and
I was going to say it too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one thing,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;If I have shocked your
particularity by the showing of that letter, it cannot touch
Miss Grant. She wrote not to you, but to a poor, common,
ordinary lad, who might have had more sense than show it.
If you are to blame me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will advise you to say no more about that girl, at all
events!&rdquo; said Catriona. &ldquo;It is her I will never look the
road of, not if she lay dying.&rdquo; She turned away from me,
and suddenly back. &ldquo;Will you swear you will have no
more to deal with her?&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, and I will never be so unjust then,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;nor yet so ungrateful.&rdquo;

And now it was I that turned away.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII</h3>

<h5>HELVOETSLUYS</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> weather in the end considerably worsened; the wind
sang in the shrouds, the sea swelled higher, and the ship
began to labour and cry out among the billows. The song
of the leadsman in the chains was now scarce ceasing, for
we thrid all the way among shoals. About nine in the
morning, in a burst of wintry sun between two squalls of hail,
I had my first look of Holland&mdash;a line of windmills birling
in the breeze. It was besides my first knowledge of these
daft-like contrivances, which gave me a near sense of foreign
travel and a new world and life. We came to an anchor
about half-past eleven, outside the harbour of Helvoetsluys,
in a place where the sea sometimes broke and the ship
pitched outrageously. You may be sure we were all on
deck, save Mrs. Gebbie, some of us in cloaks, others mantled
in the ship&rsquo;s tarpaulins, all clinging on by ropes, and jesting
the most like old sailor-folk that we could imitate.</p>

<p>Presently a boat, that was backed like a partan-crab,
came gingerly alongside, and the skipper of it hailed our
master in the Dutch. Thence Captain Sang turned, very
troubled-like, to Catriona; and, the rest of us crowding
about, the nature of the difficulty was made plain to all.
The <i>Rose</i> was bound to the port of Rotterdam, whither the
other passengers were in a great impatience to arrive, in
view of a conveyance due to leave that very evening in the
direction of the Upper Germany. This, with the present
half-gale of wind, the captain (if no time were lost) declared
himself still capable to save. Now James More had trysted
in Helvoet with his daughter, and the captain had engaged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215"></a>215</span>
to call before the port and place her (according to the
custom) in a shore boat. There was the boat, to be sure,
and here was Catriona ready: but both our master and the
patroon of the boat scrupled at the risk, and the first was in
no humour to delay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;would be geyan little pleased
if we was to break a leg to ye, Miss Drummond, let-a-be
drowning of you. Take my way of it,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and come
on-by with the rest of us here to Rotterdam. Ye can get a
passage down the Maes in a sailing scoot as far as to the
Brill, and thence on again, by a place in a rattel-waggon,
back to Helvoet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Catriona would hear of no change. She looked
white-like as she beheld the bursting of the sprays, the green
seas that sometimes poured upon the forecastle, and the
perpetual bounding and swooping of the boat among the
billows; but she stood firmly by her father&rsquo;s orders. &ldquo;My
father, James More, will have arranged it so,&rdquo; was her first
word and her last. I thought it very idle, and indeed wanton,
in the girl to be so literal and stand opposite to so much
kind advice; but the fact is she had a very good reason, if
she would have told us. Sailing scoots and rattel-waggons
are excellent things; only the use of them must first be paid
for, and all she was possessed of in the world was just two
shillings and a penny-halfpenny sterling. So it fell out that
captain and passengers, not knowing of her destitution&mdash;and
she being too proud to tell them&mdash;spoke in vain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you ken nae French and nae Dutch neither,&rdquo; said
one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very true,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;but since the year &rsquo;Forty-six
there are so many, of the honest Scots abroad that I will
be doing very well, I thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a pretty country simplicity in this that made
some laugh, others looked the more sorry, and Mr. Gebbie
fell outright in a passion. I believe he knew it was his duty
(his wife having accepted charge of the girl) to have gone
ashore with her and seen her safe: nothing would have induced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216"></a>216</span>
him to have done so, since it must have involved the
loss of his conveyance; and I think he made it up to his
conscience by the loudness of his voice. At least he broke
out upon Captain Sang, raging and saying the thing was a
disgrace; that it was mere death to try to leave the ship,
and at any event we could not cast down an innocent maid
in a boatful of nasty Holland fishers, and leave her to her
fate. I was thinking something of the same; took the mate
upon one side, arranged with him to send on my chests by
track-scoot to an address I had in Leyden, and stood up and
signalled to the fishers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go ashore with the young lady, Captain Sang,&rdquo;
said I. &ldquo;It is all one what way I go to Leyden&rdquo;; and
leaped at the same time into the boat, which I managed not
so elegantly but what I fell with two of the fishers in the
bilge.</p>

<p>From the boat the business appeared yet more precarious
than from the ship, she stood so high over us, swung
down so swift, and menaced us so perpetually with her
plunging and passaging upon the anchor cable. I began to
think I had made a fool&rsquo;s bargain, that it was merely impossible
Catriona should be got on board to me, and that I
stood to be set ashore at Helvoet all by myself and with no
hope of any reward but the pleasure of embracing James
More, if I should want to. But this was to reckon without
the lass&rsquo;s courage. She had seen me leap with very little
appearance (however much reality) of hesitation; to be sure,
she was not to be beat by her discarded friend. Up she
stood on the bulwarks and held by a stay, the wind blowing
in her petticoats, which made the enterprise more dangerous,
and gave us rather more of a view of her stockings than
would be thought genteel in cities. There was no minute
lost, and scarce time given for any to interfere, if they had
wished the same. I stood up on the other side and spread my
arms; the ship swung down on us, the patroon humoured
his boat nearer in than was perhaps wholly safe, and
Catriona leaped into the air. I was so happy as to catch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217"></a>217</span>
her, and the fishers readily supporting us, escaped a fall.
She held to me a moment very tight, breathing quick and
deep; thence (she still clinging to me with both hands)
we were passed aft to our places by the steersman;
and, Captain Sang and all the crew and passengers
cheering and crying farewell, the boat was put about
for shore.</p>

<p>As soon as Catriona came a little to herself she unhanded
me suddenly, but said no word. No more did I; and indeed
the whistling of the wind and the breaching of the sprays
made it no time for speech; and our crew not only toiled
excessively but made extremely little way, so that the <i>Rose</i>
had got her anchor and was off again before we had approached
the harbour mouth.</p>

<p>We were no sooner in smooth water than the patroon,
according to their beastly Hollands custom, stopped his
boat and required of us our fares. Two guilders was the
man&rsquo;s demand&mdash;between three and four shillings English
money&mdash;for each passenger. But at this Catriona began to
cry out with a vast deal of agitation. She had asked of
Captain Sang, she said, and the fare was but an English
shilling. &ldquo;Do you think I will have come on board and not
ask first?&rdquo; cries she. The patroon scolded back upon her
in a lingo where the oaths were English and the rest right
Hollands; till at last (seeing her near tears) I privately
slipped in the rogue&rsquo;s hand six shillings, whereupon he was
obliging enough to receive from her the other shilling without
more complaint. No doubt I was a good deal nettled
and ashamed. I like to see folk thrifty, but not with so
much passion; and I daresay it would be rather coldly that
I asked her, as the boat moved on again for shore, where it
was that she was trysted with her father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is to be inquired of at the house of one Sprott, an
honest Scots merchant,&rdquo; says she; and then with the same
breath, &ldquo;I am wishing to thank you very much&mdash;you are a
brave friend to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be time enough when I get you to your father,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218"></a>218</span>
said I, little thinking that I spoke so true. &ldquo;I can tell him
a fine tale of a loyal daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I do not think I will be a loyal girl, at all events,&rdquo;
she cried, with a great deal of painfulness in the expression.
&ldquo;I do not think my heart is true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet there are very few that would have made that
leap, and all to obey a father&rsquo;s orders,&rdquo; I observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot have you to be thinking of me so,&rdquo; she cried
again. &ldquo;When you had done that same, how would I stop
behind? And at all events that was not all the reasons.&rdquo;
Whereupon, with a burning face, she told me the plain
truth upon her poverty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good guide us!&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;what kind of daft-like proceeding
is this, to let yourself be launched on the continent
of Europe with an empty purse; I count it hardly decent&mdash;scant
decent!&rdquo; I cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You forget James More, my father, is a poor gentleman,&rdquo;
said she. &ldquo;He is a hunted exile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I think not all your friends are hunted exiles,&rdquo; I
exclaimed. &ldquo;And was this fair to them that care for you?
Was it fair to me? was it fair to Miss Grant, that counselled
you to go, and would be driven fair horn-mad if she
could hear of it? Was it even fair to these Gregory folk
that you were living with, and used you lovingly? It&rsquo;s a
blessing you have fallen in my hands! Suppose your father
hindered by an accident, what would become of you here,
and you your lee-lone in a strange place? The thought of
the thing frightens me,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will have lied to all of them,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I will
have told them all that I had plenty. I told <i>her</i> too. I
could not be lowering James More to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I found out later on that she must have lowered him in
the very dust, for the lie was originally the father&rsquo;s, not the
daughter&rsquo;s, and she thus obliged to persevere in it for the
man&rsquo;s reputation. But at the time I was ignorant of this, and
the mere thought of her destitution and the perils in which
she must have fallen, had ruffled me almost beyond reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page219"></a>219</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you will have to learn more
sense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I left her mails for the moment in an inn upon the shore,
where I got a direction for Sprott&rsquo;s house in my new French,
and we walked there&mdash;it was some little way&mdash;beholding
the place with wonder as we went. Indeed, there was much
for Scots folk to admire: canals and trees being intermingled
with the houses; the houses, each within itself, of a brave red
brick, the colour of a rose, with steps and benches of blue
marble at the cheek of every door, and the whole town so
clean you might have dined upon the causeway. Sprott
was within, upon his ledgers, in a low parlour, very neat and
clean, and set out with china and pictures and a globe of the
earth in a brass frame. He was a big-chafted, ruddy, lusty
man, with a crooked hard look to him; and he made us not
that much civility as offer us a seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is James More Macgregor now in Helvoet, sir?&rdquo; says I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ken nobody by such a name,&rdquo; says he, impatient-like.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since you are so particular,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;I will amend
my question, and ask you where we are to find in Helvoet
one James Drummond, <i>alias</i> Macgregor, <i>alias</i> James More,
late tenant in Inveronachile?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;he may be in Hell for what I ken, and
for my part I wish he was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The young lady is that gentleman&rsquo;s daughter, sir,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;before whom, I think you will agree with me, it is
not very becoming to discuss his character.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to make either with him, or her, or
you!&rdquo; cries he in his gross voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Under your favour, Mr. Sprott,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;this young
lady is come from Scotland seeking him, and, by whatever
mistake, was given the name of your house for a direction.
An error it seems to have been, but I think this places both
you and me&mdash;who am but her fellow-traveller by accident&mdash;under
a strong obligation to help our countrywoman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you ding me daft?&rdquo; he cries. &ldquo;I tell ye I ken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220"></a>220</span>
naething and care less either for him or his breed. I tell ye
the man owes me money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That may very well be, sir,&rdquo; said I, who was now
rather more angry than himself. &ldquo;At least, I owe you
nothing; the young lady is under my protection; and I am
neither at all used with these manners, nor in the least content
with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I said this, and without particularly thinking what I
did, I drew a step or two nearer to his table; thus striking,
by mere good fortune, on the only argument that could at all
affect the man. The blood left his lusty countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the Lord&rsquo;s sake dinna be hasty, sir!&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;I am truly wishfu&rsquo; no&rsquo; to be offensive. But ye ken, sir, I&rsquo;m
like a wheen guid-natured, honest, canty auld fallows&mdash;my
bark is waur nor my bite. To hear me, ye micht whiles
fancy I was a wee thing dour; but na, na! it&rsquo;s a kind auld
fallow at heart, Sandie Sprott! And ye could never imagine
the fyke and fash this man has been to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Then I will make that much
freedom with your kindness as trouble you for your last
news of Mr. Drummond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome, sir!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;As for the young
leddy (my respec&rsquo;s to her!), he&rsquo;ll just have clean forgotten
her. I ken the man, ye see; I have lost siller by him ere
now. He thinks of naebody but just himsel&rsquo;; clan, king,
or dauchter, if he can get his wameful, he would give them a&rsquo;
the go-by! ay, or his correspondent either. For there is a
sense in whilk I may be nearly almost said to be his correspondent.
The fact is, we are employed thegither in a business
affair, and I think it&rsquo;s like to turn out a dear affair for
Sandie Sprott. The man&rsquo;s as guid&rsquo;s my pairtner, and I give
ye my mere word I ken naething by where he is. He micht
be coming here to Helvoet; he micht come here the morn,
he michtna come for a twalmonth; I would wonder at naething&mdash;or
just at the ae thing, and that&rsquo;s if he was to pay me
my siller. Ye see what way I stand with it; and it&rsquo;s clear
I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; very likely to meddle up with the young leddy, as ye
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221"></a>221</span>
ca&rsquo; her. She canna stop here, that&rsquo;s ae thing certain sure.
Dod, sir, I&rsquo;m a lone man! If I was to tak&rsquo; her in, it&rsquo;s highly
possible the hellicat would try and gar me marry her when
he turned up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough of this talk,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I will take the young
lady among better friends. Give me pen, ink, and paper,
and I will leave here for James More the address of my correspondent
in Leyden. He can inquire from me where he is
to seek his daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This word I wrote and sealed; which while I was doing,
Sprott of his own motion made a welcome offer, to charge
himself with Miss Drummond&rsquo;s mails, and even send a
porter for them to the inn. I advanced him to that effect a
dollar or two to be a cover, and he gave me an acknowledgment
in writing of the sum.</p>

<p>Whereupon (I giving my arm to Catriona) we left the
house of this unpalatable rascal. She had said no word
throughout, leaving me to judge and speak in her place; I,
upon my side, had been careful not to embarrass her by a
glance; and even now, although my heart still glowed inside
of me with shame and anger, I made it my affair to seem
quite easy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;let us get back to yon same inn where
they can speak the French, have a piece of dinner, and inquire
for conveyances to Rotterdam. I will never be easy
till I have you safe again in the hands of Mrs. Gebbie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it will have to be,&rdquo; said Catriona, &ldquo;though,
whoever will be pleased, I do not think it will be her. And
I will remind you this once again, that I have but one shilling
and three bawbees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And just this once again,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I will remind you
it was a blessing that I came alongst with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What else would I be thinking all this time?&rdquo; says she,
and I thought weighed a little on my arm. &ldquo;It is you that
are the good friend to me.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII</h3>

<h5>TRAVELS IN HOLLAND</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> rattel-waggon, which is a kind of a long waggon set with
benches, carried us in four hours of travel to the great city
of Rotterdam. It was long past dark by then, but the streets
pretty brightly lighted and thronged with wild-like, outlandish
characters&mdash;bearded Hebrews, black men, and the
hordes of courtesans, most indecently adorned with finery,
and stopping seamen by their very sleeves; the clash of talk
about us made our heads to whirl; and, what was the most
unexpected of all, we appeared to be no more struck with
all these foreigners than they with us. I made the best face
I could, for the lass&rsquo;s sake and my own credit; but the truth
is, I felt like a lost sheep, and my heart beat in my bosom
with anxiety. Once or twice I inquired after the harbour or
the berth of the ship <i>Rose</i>; but either fell on some who
spoke only Hollands, or my own French failed me. Trying
a street at a venture, I came upon a lane of lighted houses,
the doors and windows thronged with wauf-like painted
women; these jostled and mocked upon us as we passed, and
I was thankful we had nothing of their language. A little
after we issued forth upon an open place along the harbour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall be doing now,&rdquo; cries I, as soon as I spied
masts. &ldquo;Let us walk here by the harbour. We are sure to
meet some that has the English, and at the best of it we may
light upon that very ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We did the next best, as happened; for, about nine of the
evening, whom should we walk into the arms of but Captain
Sang? He told us they had made their run in the most incredible
brief time, the wind holding strong till they reached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223"></a>223</span>
port; by which means his passengers were all gone already
on their further travels. It was impossible to chase after
the Gebbies into the High Germany, and we had no other
acquaintance to fall back upon but Captain Sang himself.
It was the more gratifying to find the man friendly and wishful
to assist. He made it a small affair to find some good
plain family of merchants, where Catriona might harbour
till the <i>Rose</i> was loaden; declared he would then blithely
carry her back to Leith for nothing and see her safe in the
hands of Mr. Gregory; and in the meanwhile carried us to a
late ordinary for the meal we stood in need of. He seemed
extremely friendly, as I say, but, what surprised me a good
deal, rather boisterous in the bargain; and the cause of this
was soon to appear. For at the ordinary, calling for Rhenish
wine and drinking of it deep, he soon became unutterably
tipsy. In this case, as too common with all men, but especially
with those of his rough trade, what little sense or manners
he possessed deserted him; and he behaved himself so
scandalous to the young lady, jesting most ill-favouredly at
the figure she had made on the ship&rsquo;s rail, that I had no
resource but carry her suddenly away.</p>

<p>She came out of that ordinary clinging to me close.
&ldquo;Take me away, David,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;<i>You</i> keep me. I
am not afraid with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And have no cause, my little friend!&rdquo; cried I, and
could have found it in my heart to weep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where will you be taking me?&rdquo; she said again.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me, at all events&mdash;never leave me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where am I taking you indeed?&rdquo; says I, stopping,
for I had been staving on ahead in mere blindness. &ldquo;I
must stop and think. But I&rsquo;ll not leave you, Catriona; the
Lord do so to me, and more also, if I should fail or fash you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She crept closer in to me by way of a reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is the stillest place that we have hit on
yet in this busy byke of a city. Let us sit down here under
yon tree and consider of our course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That tree (which I am little like to forget) stood hard by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224"></a>224</span>
the harbour-side. It was a black night, but lights were in
the houses, and nearer hand in the quiet ships; there was a
shining of the city on the one hand, and a buzz hung over it
of many thousands walking and talking; on the other, it was
dark, and the water bubbled on the sides. I spread my
cloak upon a builder&rsquo;s stone, and made her sit there; she
would have kept her hold upon me, for she still shook with
the late affronts; but I wanted to think clear, disengaged
myself, and paced to and fro before her, in the manner of
what we call a smuggler&rsquo;s walk, belabouring my brains for
any remedy. By the course of these scattering thoughts I
was brought suddenly face to face with a remembrance that,
in the heat and haste of our departure, I had left Captain
Sang to pay the ordinary. At this I began to laugh out
loud, for I thought the man well served; and at the same
time, by an instinctive movement, carried my hand to the
pocket where my money was. I suppose it was in the lane
where the women jostled us; but there is only the one thing
certain, that my purse was gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will have thought of something good,&rdquo; said she,
observing me to pause.</p>

<p>At the pinch we were in, my mind became suddenly clear
as a perspective-glass, and I saw there was no choice of
methods. I had not one doit of coin, but in my pocket-book
I had still my letter on the Leyden merchant; and there was
now but the one way to get to Leyden, and that was to walk
on our two feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catriona,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re brave, and I believe
you&rsquo;re strong&mdash;do you think you could walk thirty miles on
a plain road?&rdquo; We found it, I believe, scarce the two-thirds
of that, but such was my notion of the distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;David,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you will just keep near, I will go
anywhere and do anything. The courage of my heart, it is
all broken. Do not be leaving me in this horrible country
by myself, and I will do all else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you start now and march all night?&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do all that you can ask of me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225"></a>225</span>
never ask you why. I have been a bad, ungrateful girl to
you; and do what you please with me now! And I think
Miss Barbara Grant is the best lady in the world,&rdquo; she added,
&ldquo;and I do not see what she would deny you for at all
events.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was Greek and Hebrew to me; but I had other
matters to consider, and the first of these was to get clear of
that city on the Leyden road. It proved a cruel problem;
and it may have been one or two at night ere we had solved
it. Once beyond the houses, there was neither moon nor
stars to guide us; only the whiteness of the way in the midst,
and a blackness of an alley on both hands. The walking
was besides made most extraordinary difficult by a plain
black frost that fell suddenly in the small hours and turned
that highway into one long slide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Catriona,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;here we are, like the king&rsquo;s
sons and the old wives&rsquo; daughters in your daft-like Highland
tales. Soon we&rsquo;ll be going over the &lsquo;<i>seven Bens, the
seven glens, and the seven mountain moors</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;which was a
common byword or overcome in those tales of hers that had
stuck in my memory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;but here are no glens or mountains!
Though I will never be denying but what the trees and some
of the plain places hereabouts are very pretty. But our
country is the best yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish we could say as much for our own folk,&rdquo; says I,
recalling Sprott and Sang, and perhaps James More himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will never complain of the country of my friend,&rdquo;
said she, and spoke it out with an accent so particular that
I seemed to see the look upon her face.</p>

<p>I caught in my breath sharp and came near falling (for
my pains) on the black ice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know what <i>you</i> think, Catriona,&rdquo; said I, when
I was a little recovered, &ldquo;but this has been the best day yet!
I think shame to say it, when you have met in with such
misfortunes and disfavours; but for me, it has been the
best day yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page226"></a>226</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a good day when you showed me so much love,&rdquo;
said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet I think shame to be happy too,&rdquo; I went on,
&ldquo;and you here on the road in the black night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where in the great world would I be else?&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;I am thinking I am safest where I am with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am quite forgiven, then?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you not forgive me that time so much as not to
take it in your mouth again?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;There is nothing
in this heart to you but thanks. But I will be honest too,&rdquo;
she added, with a kind of suddenness, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll never can
forgive that girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Miss Grant again?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;You said yourself
she was the best lady in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So she will be, indeed!&rdquo; says Catriona. &ldquo;But I will
never forgive her for all that. I will never, never forgive
her, and let me hear tell of her no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;this beats all that ever came to my
knowledge; and I wonder that you can indulge yourself in
such bairnly whims. Here is a young lady that was the
best friend in the world to the both of us, that learned us
how to dress ourselves, and in a great manner how to behave,
as any one can see that knew us both before and after.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Catriona stopped square in the midst of the highway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is this way of it,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Either you will go on
to speak of her, and I will go back to yon town, and let come
of it what God pleases! Or else you will do me that politeness
to talk of other things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was the most nonplussed person in this world; but I
bethought me that she depended altogether on my help,
that she was of the frail sex, and not so much beyond a child,
and it was for me to be wise for the pair of us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear girl,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I can make neither head nor
tails of this; but God forbid that I should do anything to set
you on the jee. As for talking of Miss Grant, I have no such
a mind to it, and I believe it was yourself began it. My
only design (if I took you up at all) was for your own improvement,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227"></a>227</span>
for I hate the very look of injustice. Not that
I do not wish you to have a good pride and a nice female
delicacy; they become you well; but here you show them
to excess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, have you done?&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have done,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very good thing,&rdquo; said she, and we went on again,
but now in silence.</p>

<p>It was an eerie employment to walk in the gross night,
beholding only shadows, and hearing nought but our own
steps. At first, I believe our hearts burned against each
other with a deal of enmity; but the darkness and the
cold, and the silence, which only the cocks sometimes interrupted,
or sometimes the farmyard dogs, had pretty soon
brought down our pride to the dust; and for my own particular,
I would have jumped at any decent opening for speech.</p>

<p>Before the day peeped, came on a warmish rain, and
the frost was all wiped away from among our feet. I took
my cloak to her and sought to hap her in the same; she bade
me, rather impatiently, to keep it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed and I will do no such thing,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Here
am I, a great, ugly lad that has seen all kinds of weather,
and here are you, a tender, pretty maid! My dear, you
would not put me to a shame?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without more words she let me cover her; which as I
was doing in the darkness, I let my hand rest a moment on
her shoulder, almost like an embrace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must try to be more patient of your friend,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>I thought she seemed to lean the least thing in the world
against my bosom, or perhaps it was but fancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There will be no end to your goodness,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>And we went on again in silence; but now all was
changed; and the happiness that was in my heart was like
a fire in a great chimney.</p>

<p>The rain passed ere day; it was but a sloppy morning as
we came into the town of Delft. The red-gabled houses made
a handsome show on either hand of a canal; the servant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228"></a>228</span>
lasses were out slaistering and scrubbing at the very stones
upon the public highway; smoke rose from a hundred
kitchens; and it came in upon me strongly it was time to
break our fasts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catriona,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I believe you have yet a shilling
and three bawbees?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you wanting it?&rdquo; said she, and passed me her
purse. &ldquo;I am wishing it was five pounds! What will you
want it for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what have we been walking for all night, like a
pair of waif Egyptians?&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;Just because I was
robbed of my purse and all I possessed in that unchancy
town of Rotterdam. I will tell you of it now, because I
think the worst is over, but we have still a good tramp before
us till we get to where my money is, and if you would not
buy me a piece of bread, I were like to go fasting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at me with open eyes. By the light of the
new day she was all black and pale for weariness, so that
my heart smote me for her. But as for her, she broke out
laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My torture! are we beggars then?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You
too? O, I could have wished for this same thing! And I
am glad to buy your breakfast to you. But it would be
pleisand if I would have had to dance to get a meal to you!
For I believe they are not very well acquainted with our
manner of dancing over here, and might be paying for the
curiosity of that sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could have kissed her for that word, not with a lover&rsquo;s
mind, but in a heat of admiration. For it always warms a
man to see a woman brave.</p>

<p>We got a drink of milk from a country wife but new come
to the town, and, in a baker&rsquo;s, a piece of excellent, hot, sweet-smelling
bread, which we ate upon the road as we went on.
That road from Delft to the Hague is just five miles of a fine
avenue shaded with trees, a canal on the one hand, on the
other excellent pastures of cattle. It was pleasant here
indeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page229"></a>229</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, Davie,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;what will you do with me
at all events?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is what we have to speak of,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and the
sooner yet the better. I can come by money in Leyden;
that will be all well. But the trouble is how to dispose of
you until your father come. I thought last night you seemed
a little sweer to part from me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be more than seeming then,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a very young maid,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I am but a
very young callant. This is a great piece of difficulty.
What way are we to manage? Unless, indeed, you could
pass to be my sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what for no?&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if you would let me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you were so, indeed!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;I would be a
fine man if I had such a sister. But the rub is that you are
Catriona Drummond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now I will be Catrine Balfour,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And
who is to ken? They are all strange folk here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you think that it would do,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;I own it
troubles me. I would like it very ill, if I advised you at all
wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;David, I have no friend here but you,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mere truth is, I am too young to be your friend,&rdquo;
said I. &ldquo;I am too young to advise you, or you to be advised.
I see not what else we are to do, and yet I ought to
warn you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will have no choice left,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;My father
James More has not used me very well, and it is not the first
time. I am cast upon your hands like a sack of barley-meal,
and have nothing else to think of but your pleasure.
If you will have me, good and well. If you will not&rdquo;&mdash;she
turned and touched her hand upon my arm&mdash;&ldquo;David, I am
afraid,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but I ought to warn you,&rdquo; I began; and then bethought
me that I was the bearer of the purse, and it would
never do to seem too churlish. &ldquo;Catriona,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
misunderstand me: I am just trying to do my duty by you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230"></a>230</span>
girl! Here am I, going alone to this strange city, to be a
solitary student there; and here is this chance arisen that
you might dwell with me a bit, and be like my sister: you
can surely understand this much, my dear, that I would just
love to have you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and here I am,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s soon
settled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I know I was in duty bounden to have spoke more plain.
I know this was a great blot upon my character, for which I
was lucky that I did not pay more dear. But I minded how
easy her delicacy had been startled with a word of kissing her
in Barbara&rsquo;s letter; now that she depended on me, how was
I to be more bold? Besides, the truth is, I could see no
other feasible method to dispose of her. And I daresay inclination
pulled me very strong.</p>

<p>A little beyond the Hague she fell very lame, and made
the rest of the distance heavily enough. Twice she must
rest by the wayside, which she did with pretty apologies,
calling herself a shame to the Highlands and the race she
came of, and nothing but a hindrance to myself. It was her
excuse, she said, that she was not much used with walking
shod. I would have had her strip off her shoes and stockings
and go barefoot. But she pointed out to me that the women
of that country, even in the landward roads, appeared to be
all shod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must not be disgracing my brother,&rdquo; said she, and
was very merry with it all, although her face told tales of
her.</p>

<p>There is a garden in that city we were bound to, sanded
below with clean sand, the trees meeting overhead, some of
them trimmed, some pleached, and the whole place beautified
with alleys and arbours. Here I left Catriona, and went
forward by myself to find my correspondent. There I drew
on my credit, and asked to be recommended to some decent,
retired lodging. My baggage not being yet arrived, I told
him I supposed I should require his caution with the people
of the house; and explained that, my sister being come for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231"></a>231</span>
while to keep house with me, I should be wanting two
chambers. This was all very well; but the trouble was that
Mr. Balfour in his letter of recommendation had condescended
on a great deal of particulars, and never a word of
any sister in the case. I could see my Dutchman was extremely
suspicious; and viewing me over the rims of a great
pair of spectacles&mdash;he was a poor, frail body, and reminded
me of an infirm rabbit&mdash;he began to question me close.</p>

<p>Here I fell in a panic. Suppose he accept my tale (thinks
I), suppose he invite my sister to his house, and that I bring
her. I shall have a fine ravelled pirn to unwind, and may
end by disgracing both the lassie and myself. Thereupon I
began hastily to expound to him my sister&rsquo;s character. She
was of a bashful disposition, it appeared, and so extremely
fearful of meeting strangers that I had left her at that
moment sitting in a public place alone. And then, being
launched upon the stream of falsehood, I must do like all
the rest of the world in the same circumstance, and plunge
in deeper than was any service; adding some altogether
needless particulars of Miss Balfour&rsquo;s ill-health and retirement
during childhood. In the midst of which I awoke to a
sense of my behaviour, and was turned to one blush.</p>

<p>The old gentleman was not so much deceived but what
he discovered a willingness to be quit of me. But he was
first of all a man of business; and knowing that my money
was good enough, however it might be with my conduct, he
was so far obliging as to send his son to be my guide and
caution in the matter of a lodging. This implied my presenting
of the young man to Catriona. The poor, pretty
child was much recovered with resting, looked and behaved
to perfection, and took my arm and gave me the name of
brother more easily than I could answer her. But there
was one misfortune: thinking to help, she was rather towardly
than otherwise to my Dutchman. And I could not
but reflect that Miss Balfour had rather suddenly outgrown
her bashfulness. And there was another thing, the difference
of our speech. I had the Low-Country tongue and dwelled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232"></a>232</span>
upon my words; she had a hill voice, spoke with something
of an English accent, only far more delightful, and was
scarce quite fit to be called a deacon in the craft of talking
English grammar; so that, for a brother and sister, we made
a most uneven pair. But the young Hollander was a heavy
dog, without so much spirit in his belly as to remark her
prettiness, for which I scorned him. And as soon as he had
found a cover to our heads, he left us alone, which was the
greater service of the two.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV</h3>

<h5>FULL STORY OF A COPY OF HEINECCIUS</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> place found was in the upper part of a house backed on
a canal. We had two rooms, the second entering from the
first; each had a chimney built out into the floor in the
Dutch manner; and being alongside, each had the same
prospect from the window of the top of a tree below us in a
little court, of a piece of the canal, and of houses in the
Hollands architecture and a church spire upon the farther
side. A full set of bells hung in that spire, and made delightful
music; and when there was any sun at all, it shone
direct in our two chambers. From a tavern hard by we
had good meals sent in.</p>

<p>The first night we were both pretty weary, and she extremely
so. There was little talk between us, and I packed
her off to her bed as soon as she had eaten. The first thing
in the morning I wrote word to Sprott to have her mails
sent on, together with a line to Alan at his chief&rsquo;s; and had
the same despatched, and her breakfast ready, ere I waked
her. I was a little abashed when she came forth in her one
habit, and the mud of the way upon her stockings. By
what inquiries I had made, it seemed a good few days must
pass before her mails could come to hand in Leyden, and it
was plainly needful she must have a shift of things. She
was unwilling at first that I should go to that expense; but
I reminded her she was now a rich man&rsquo;s sister, and must
appear suitably in the part, and we had not got to the second
merchant&rsquo;s before she was entirely charmed into the spirit
of the thing, and her eyes shining. It pleased me to see her
so innocent and thorough in this pleasure. What was more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234"></a>234</span>
extraordinary was the passion into which I fell on it myself;
being never satisfied that I had bought her enough or fine
enough, and never weary of beholding her in different attires.
Indeed, I began to understand some little of Miss Grant&rsquo;s
immersion in that interest of clothes; for the truth is, when
you have the ground of a beautiful person to adorn, the
whole business becomes beautiful. The Dutch chintzes I
should say were extraordinary cheap and fine; but I would
be ashamed to set down what I paid for stockings to her.
Altogether I spent so great a sum upon this pleasuring (as I
may call it) that I was ashamed for a great while to spend
more; and, by way of a set-off, I left our chambers pretty
bare. If we had beds, if Catriona was a little braw, and I
had light to see her by, we were richly enough lodged for me.</p>

<p>By the end of this merchandising I was glad to leave her
at the door with all our purchases, and go for a long walk
alone in which to read myself a lecture. Here had I taken
under my roof, and as good as to my bosom, a young lass extremely
beautiful, and whose innocence was her peril. My
talk with the old Dutchman, and the lies to which I was
constrained, had already given me a sense of how my conduct
must appear to others; and now, after the strong
admiration I had just experienced and the immoderacy with
which I had continued my vain purchases, I began to think
of it myself as very hazarded. I bethought me, if I had a
sister indeed, whether I would so expose her; then, judging
the case too problematical, I varied my question into this,
whether I would so trust Catriona in the hands of any other
Christian being: the answer to which made my face to burn.
The more cause, since I had been entrapped, and had entrapped
the girl into an undue situation, that I should behave
in it with scrupulous nicety. She depended on me
wholly for her bread and shelter; in case I should alarm her
delicacy, she had no retreat. Besides, I was her host and
her protector; and the more irregularly I had fallen in these
positions, the less excuse for me if I should profit by the same
to forward even the most honest suit; for with the opportunities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235"></a>235</span>
that I enjoyed, and which no wise parent would have
suffered for a moment, even the most honest suit would be
unfair. I saw I must be extremely hold-off in my relations;
and yet not too much so neither; for if I had no right to
appear at all in the character of a suitor, I must yet appear
continually, and if possible agreeably, in that of host. It was
plain I should require a great deal of tact and conduct, perhaps
more than my years afforded. But I had rushed in
where angels might have feared to tread, and there was no
way out of that position save by behaving right while I was
in it. I made a set of rules for my guidance; prayed for
strength to be enabled to observe them, and as a more
human aid to the same end purchased a study-book in law.
This being all that I could think of, I relaxed from these
grave considerations; whereupon my mind bubbled at once
into an effervescency of pleasing spirits, and it was like one
treading on air that I turned homeward. As I thought
that name of home, and recalled the image of that figure
awaiting me between four walls, my heart beat upon my
bosom.</p>

<p>My troubles began with my return. She ran to greet me
with an obvious and affecting pleasure. She was clad,
besides, entirely in the new clothes that I had bought for
her; looked in them beyond expression well; and must walk
about and drop me curtsies to display them and to be admired.
I am sure I did it with an ill grace, for I thought to
have choked upon the words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you will not be caring for my pretty
clothes, see what I have done with our two chambers.&rdquo;
And she showed me the place all very finely swept, and the
fires glowing in the two chimneys.</p>

<p>I was glad of a chance to seem a little more severe than
I quite felt. &ldquo;Catriona,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am very much displeased
with you, and you must never again lay a hand upon
my room. One of us two must have the rule while we are
here together; it is most fit it should be I, who am both the
man and the elder; and I give you that for my command.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page236"></a>236</span></p>

<p>She dropped me one of her curtsies, which were extraordinary
taking. &ldquo;If you will be cross,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I must
be making pretty manners at you, Davie. I will be very
obedient, as I should be when every stitch upon all there is
of me belongs to you. But you will not be very cross either,
because now I have not anyone else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This struck me hard, and I made haste, in a kind of
penitence, to blot out all the good effect of my last speech.
In this direction progress was more easy, being down hill;
she led me forward, smiling; at the sight of her, in the
brightness of the fire and with her pretty becks and looks,
my heart was altogether melted. We made our meal with
infinite mirth and tenderness; and the two seemed to be
commingled into one, so that our very laughter sounded like
a kindness.</p>

<p>In the midst of which I awoke to better recollections,
made a lame word of excuse, and set myself boorishly to
my studies. It was a substantial, instructive book that I
had bought, by the late Dr. Heineccius, in which I was to do
a great deal of reading these next days, and often very glad
that I had no one to question me of what I read. Methought
she bit her lip at me a little, and that cut me.
Indeed, it left her wholly solitary, the more as she was very
little of a reader, and had never a book. But what was I
to do?</p>

<p>So the rest of the evening flowed by almost without
speech.</p>

<p>I could have beat myself. I could not lie in my bed that
night for rage and repentance, but walked to and fro on my
bare feet till I was nearly perished, for the chimney was
gone out and the frost keen. The thought of her in the
next room, the thought that she might even hear me as
I walked, the remembrance of my churlishness and that I
must continue to practise the same ungrateful course or be
dishonoured, put me beside my reason. I stood like a man
between Scylla and Charybdis: <i>What must she think of me?</i>
was my one thought that softened me continually into weakness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237"></a>237</span>
<i>What is to become of us?</i> the other which steeled me
again to resolution. This was my first night of wakefulness
and divided counsels, of which I was now to pass many,
pacing like a madman, sometimes weeping like a childish
boy, sometimes praying (I would fain hope) like a Christian.</p>

<p>But prayer is not very difficult, and the hitch comes in
practice. In her presence, and above all if I allowed any
beginning of familiarity, I found I had very little command
of what should follow. But to sit all day in the same room
with her, and feign to be engaged upon Heineccius, surpassed
my strength. So that I fell instead upon the expedient
of absenting myself so much as I was able; taking
out classes and sitting there regularly, often with small
attention, the test of which I found the other day in a notebook
of that period, where I had left off to follow an edifying
lecture, and actually scribbled in my book some very ill
verses, though the Latinity is rather better than I thought I
could ever have compassed. The evil of this course was unhappily
near as great as its advantage. I had the less time
of trial, but I believe, while that time lasted, I was tried the
more extremely. For she being so much left to solitude, she
came to greet my return with an increasing fervour that came
nigh to overmaster me. These friendly offers I must barbarously
cast back; and my rejection sometimes wounded
her so cruelly that I must unbend and seek to make it up to
her in kindness. So that our time passed in ups and downs,
tiffs and disappointments, upon the which I could almost
say (if it may be said with reverence) that I was crucified.</p>

<p>The base of my trouble was Catriona&rsquo;s extraordinary
innocence, at which I was not so much surprised as filled
with pity and admiration. She seemed to have no thought
of our position, no sense of my struggles; welcomed any
mark of my weakness with responsive joy; and, when I was
drove again to my retrenchments, did not always dissemble
her chagrin. There were times when I have thought to
myself, &ldquo;If she were over head in love, and set her cap to
catch me, she would scarce behave much otherwise&rdquo;; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238"></a>238</span>
then I would fall again into wonder at the simplicity of
woman, from whom I felt (in these moments) that I was not
worthy to be descended.</p>

<p>There was one point in particular on which our warfare
turned, and of all things, this was the question of her clothes.
My baggage had soon followed me from Rotterdam, and hers
from Helvoet. She had now, as it were, two wardrobes;
and it grew to be understood between us (I could never tell
how) that when she was friendly she would wear my clothes,
and when otherwise her own. It was meant for a buffet,
and (as it were) the renunciation of her gratitude; and I felt
it so in my bosom, but was generally more wise than to
appear to have observed the circumstance.</p>

<p>Once, indeed, I was betrayed into a childishness greater
than her own; it fell in this way. On my return from
classes, thinking upon her devoutly with a great deal of
love and a good deal of annoyance in the bargain, the annoyance
began to fade away out of my mind; and spying in a
window one of those forced flowers, of which the Hollanders
are so skilled in the artifice, I gave way to an impulse and
bought it for Catriona. I do not know the name of that
flower, but it was of the pink colour, and I thought she
would admire the same, and carried it home to her with a
wonderful soft heart. I had left her in my clothes, and
when I returned to find her all changed, and a face to
match, I cast but the one look at her from head to foot,
ground my teeth together, flung the window open, and my
flower into the court, and then (between rage and prudence)
myself out of that room again, of which I slammed the door
as I went out.</p>

<p>On the steep stair I came near falling, and this brought
me to myself, so that I began at once to see the folly of my
conduct. I went, not into the street as I had purposed,
but to the house court, which was always a solitary place,
and where I saw my flower (that had cost me vastly more
than it was worth) hanging in the leafless tree. I stood
by the side of the canal, and looked upon the ice. Country-people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239"></a>239</span>
went by on their skates, and I envied them. I could
see no way out of the pickle I was in: no way so much as
to return to the room I had just left. No doubt was in my
mind but I had now betrayed the secret of my feelings;
and, to make things worse, I had shown at the same time
(and that with wretched boyishness) incivility to my helpless
guest.</p>

<p>I suppose she must have seen me from the open window.
It did not seem to me that I had stood there very long
before I heard the crunching of footsteps on the frozen
snow, and turning somewhat angrily (for I was in no spirit
to be interrupted) saw Catriona drawing near. She was
all changed again, to the clocked stockings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we not to have our walk to-day?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>I was looking at her in a maze. &ldquo;Where is your
brooch?&rdquo; says I.</p>

<p>She carried her hand to her bosom and coloured high.
&ldquo;I will have forgotten it,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I will run upstairs
for it quick, and then surely we&rsquo;ll can have our walk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a note of pleading in that last that staggered
me; I had neither words nor voice to utter them; I could
do no more than nod by way of answer; and the moment
she had left me, climbed into the tree and recovered my
flower, which on her return I offered her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bought it for you, Catriona,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>She fixed it in the midst of her bosom with the brooch,
I could have thought tenderly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is none the better of my handling,&rdquo; said I again,
and blushed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will be liking it none the worse, you may be sure,
of that,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>We did not speak so much that day; she seemed a
thought on the reserve, though not unkindly. As for me,
all the time of our walking, and after we came home, and
I had seen her put my flower into a pot of water, I was
thinking to myself what puzzles women were. I was thinking,
the one moment, it was the most stupid thing on earth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240"></a>240</span>
she should not have perceived my love; and the next, that
she had certainly perceived it long ago, and (being a wise
girl, with the fine female instinct of propriety) concealed
her knowledge.</p>

<p>We had our walk daily. Out in the streets I felt more
safe; I relaxed a little in my guardedness; and for one
thing, there was no Heineccius. This made these periods
not only a relief to myself, but a particular pleasure to my
poor child. When I came back about the hour appointed,
I would generally find her ready dressed and glowing with
anticipation. She would prolong their duration to the
extreme, seeming to dread (as I did myself) the hour of
the return; and there is scarce a field or waterside near
Leyden, scarce a street or lane there, where we have not
lingered. Outside of these, I bade her confine herself entirely
to our lodgings; this in the fear of her encountering
any acquaintance, which would have rendered our position
very difficult. From the same apprehension I would never
suffer her to attend church, nor even go myself; but made
some kind of shift to hold worship privately in our own
chamber&mdash;I hope with an honest, but I am quite sure with
a very much divided mind. Indeed, there was scarce anything
that more affected me than thus to kneel down alone
with her before God like man and wife.</p>

<p>One day it was snowing downright hard. I had thought
it not possible that we should venture forth, and was surprised
to find her waiting for me ready dressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not be doing without my walk,&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;You are never a good boy, Davie, in the house; I will
never be caring for you only in the open air. I think we
two will better turn Egyptian and dwell by the roadside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was the best walk yet of all of them; she clung
near to me in the falling snow; it beat about and melted
on us, and the drops stood upon her bright cheeks like tears
and ran into her smiling mouth. Strength seemed to come
upon me with the sight like a giant&rsquo;s; I thought I could
have caught her up and run with her into the uttermost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241"></a>241</span>
places in the earth; and we spoke together all that time
beyond belief for freedom and sweetness.</p>

<p>It was the dark night when we came to the house-door.
She pressed my arm upon her bosom. &ldquo;Thank you kindly
for these same good hours,&rdquo; said she, on a deep note of her
voice.</p>

<p>The concern in which I fell instantly on this address
put me with the same swiftness on my guard; and we were
no sooner in the chamber, and the light made, than she
beheld the old, dour, stubborn countenance of the student
of Heineccius. Doubtless she was more than usually hurt;
and I know for myself I found it more than usually difficult
to maintain my strangeness. Even at the meal I durst
scarce unbuckle and scarce lift my eyes to her; and it was
no sooner over than I fell again to my civilian, with more
seeming abstraction and less understanding than before.
Methought, as I read, I could hear my heart strike like an
eight-day clock. Hard as I feigned to study, there was still
some of my eyesight that spilled beyond the book upon
Catriona. She sat on the floor by the side of my great
mail, and the chimney lighted her up, and shone and blinked
upon her, and made her glow and darken through a wonder
of fine hues. Now she would be gazing in the fire, and then
again at me: and at that I would be plunged in a terror
of myself, and turn the pages of Heineccius like a man looking
for the text in church.</p>

<p>Suddenly she called out aloud. &ldquo;O, why does not
my father come?&rdquo; she cried, and fell at once into a storm
of tears.</p>

<p>I leapt up, flung Heineccius fairly in the fire, ran to her
side, and cast an arm round her sobbing body.</p>

<p>She put me from her sharply. &ldquo;You do not love your
friend,&rdquo; says she. &ldquo;I could be so happy too, if you would
let me!&rdquo; And then, &ldquo;O, what will I have done that you
should hate me so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hate you!&rdquo; cries I, and held her firm. &ldquo;You blind
lass, can you not see a little in my wretched heart? Do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242"></a>242</span>
you think when I sit there, reading in that fool-book that
I have just burned, and be damned to it, I take ever the
least thought of any stricken thing but just yourself?
Night after night I could have grat to see you sitting there
your lone. And what was I to do? You are here under
my honour; would you punish me for that? Is it for that
that you would spurn a loving servant?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the word, with a small, sudden motion, she clung
near to me. I raised her face to mine, I kissed it, and
she bowed her brow upon my bosom, clasping me tight.
I sat in a mere whirl, like a man drunken. Then I
heard her voice sound very small and muffled in my
clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you kiss her truly?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>There went through me so great a heave of surprise that
I was all shook with it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Grant!&rdquo; I cried, all in a disorder. &ldquo;Yes, I
asked her to kiss me good-bye, the which she did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you have kissed me too, at all
events.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the strangeness and sweetness of that word I saw
where we had fallen; rose, and set her on her feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This will never do,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;This will never, never
do. O, Catrine, Catrine!&rdquo; Then there came a pause
in which I was debarred from any speaking. And then,
&ldquo;Go away to your bed,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Go away to your bed
and leave me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned to obey me like a little child, and the next
I knew of it had stopped in the very doorway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night, Davie!&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And O, good-night, my love!&rdquo; I cried, with a great
outbreak of my soul, and caught her to me again, so that
it seemed I must have broken her. The next moment I
had thrust her from the room, shut-to the door even with
violence, and stood alone.</p>

<p>The milk was spilt now, the word was out and the truth
told. I had crept like an untrusty man into the poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243"></a>243</span>
maid&rsquo;s affections; she was in my hand like any frail, innocent
thing to make or mar; and what weapon of defence
was left me? It seemed like a symbol that Heineccius,
my old protection, was now burned. I repented, yet could
not find it in my heart to blame myself for that great failure.
It seemed not possible to have resisted the boldness of her
innocence or that last temptation of her weeping. And
all that I had to excuse me did but make my sin appear the
greater&mdash;it was upon a nature so defenceless, and with
such advantages of the position, that I seemed to have
practised.</p>

<p>What was to become of us now? It seemed we could
no longer dwell in the one place. But where was I to go?
or where she? Without either choice or fault of ours, life
had conspired to wall us together in that narrow place. I
had a wild thought of marrying out of hand; and the next
moment put it from me with revolt. She was a child, she
could not tell her own heart; I had surprised her weakness,
I must never go on to build on that surprisal; I must keep
her not only clear of reproach, but free as she had come
to me.</p>

<p>Down I sat before the fire, and reflected, and repented,
and beat my brains in vain for any means of escape. About
two of the morning, there were three red embers left, and
the house and all the city was asleep, when I was aware of
a small sound of weeping in the next room. She thought
that I slept, the poor soul; she regretted her weakness&mdash;and
what perhaps (God help her!) she called her forwardness&mdash;and
in the dead of the night solaced herself with tears.
Tender and bitter feelings, love and penitence and pity,
struggled in my soul; it seemed I was under bond to heal
that weeping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, try to forgive me!&rdquo; I cried out, &ldquo;try, try to forgive
me. Let us forget it all, let us try if we&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; can
forget it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There came no answer, but the sobbing ceased. I
stood a long while with my hands still clasped as I had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244"></a>244</span>
spoken; then the cold of the night laid hold upon me with
a shudder, and I think my reason reawakened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can make no hand of this, Davie,&rdquo; thinks I.
&ldquo;To bed with you, like a wise lad, and try if you can sleep.
To-morrow you may see your way.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV</h3>

<h5>THE RETURN OF JAMES MORE</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">I was</span> called on the morrow out of a late and troubled
slumber by a knocking on my door, ran to open it, and had
almost swooned with the contrariety of my feelings, mostly
painful; for on the threshold, in a rough wrap-rascal and
an extraordinary big laced hat, there stood James More.</p>

<p>I ought to have been glad perhaps without admixture,
for there was a sense in which the man came like an answer
to prayer. I had been saying till my head was weary that
Catriona and I must separate, and looking till my head
ached for any possible means of separation. Here were
the means come to me upon two legs, and joy was the hind-most
of my thoughts. It is to be considered, however,
that even if the weight of the future were lifted off me by
the man&rsquo;s arrival, the present heaved up the more black
and menacing; so that, as I first stood before him in my
shirt and breeches, I believe I took a leaping step backward
like a person shot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have found you, Mr. Balfour,&rdquo; and
offered me his large, fine hand, the which (recovering at
the same time my post in the doorway, as if with some
thought of resistance) I took him by doubtfully. &ldquo;It is
a remarkable circumstance how our affairs appear to intermingle,&rdquo;
he continued. &ldquo;I am owing you an apology for
an unfortunate intrusion upon yours, which I suffered
myself to be entrapped into by my confidence in that false-face,
Prestongrange; I think shame to own to you that I
was ever trusting to a lawyer.&rdquo; He shrugged his shoulders
with a very French air. &ldquo;But indeed the man is very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246"></a>246</span>
plausible,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;And now it seems that you have
busied yourself handsomely in the matter of my daughter,
for whose direction I was remitted to yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think, sir,&rdquo; said I, with a very painful air, &ldquo;that it
will be necessary we two should have an explanation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing amiss?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;My agent,
Mr. Sprott&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake moderate your voice!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;She
must not hear till we have had an explanation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is in this place?&rdquo; cries he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is her chamber-door,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are here with her alone?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who else would I have got to stay with us?&rdquo;
cries I.</p>

<p>I will do him the justice to admit that he turned pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is very unusual,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;This is a very unusual
circumstance. You are right, we must hold an explanation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he passed me by, and I must own the tall
old rogue appeared at that moment extraordinary dignified.
He had now, for the first time, the view of my chamber,
which I scanned (I may say) with his eyes. A bit of morning
sun glinted in by the window-pane, and showed it off;
my bed, my mails, and washing-dish, with some disorder
of my clothes, and the unlighted chimney, made the only
plenishing; no mistake but it looked bare and cold, and the
most unsuitable, beggarly place conceivable to harbour a
young lady. At the same time came in on my mind the
recollection of the clothes that I had bought for her; and
I thought this contrast of poverty and prodigality bore an
ill appearance.</p>

<p>He looked all about the chamber for a seat, and finding
nothing else to his purpose except my bed, took a place upon
the side of it; where, after I had closed the door, I could
not very well avoid joining him. For however this extraordinary
interview might end, it must pass, if possible,
without waking Catriona; and the one thing needful was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247"></a>247</span>
that we should sit close and talk low. But I can scarce
picture what a pair we made; he in his great-coat, which
the coldness of my chamber made extremely suitable; I
shivering in my shirt and breeks; he with very much the
air of a judge; and I (whatever I looked) with very much
the feelings of a man who has heard the last trumpet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p>And &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I began, but found myself unable to go
further.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You tell me she is here?&rdquo; said he again, but now with
a spice of impatience that seemed to brace me up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is in this house,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I knew the circumstance
would be called unusual. But you are to consider
how very unusual the whole business was from the beginning.
Here is a young lady landed on the coast of Europe
with two shillings and a penny-halfpenny. She is directed
to yon man Sprott in Helvoet. I hear you call him your
agent. All I can say is he could do nothing but damn and
swear at the mere mention of your name, and I must fee
him out of my own pocket even to receive the custody of
her effects. You speak of unusual circumstances, Mr.
Drummond, if that be the name you prefer. Here was a
circumstance, if you like, to which it was barbarity to have
exposed her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this is what I cannot understand the least,&rdquo; said
James. &ldquo;My daughter was placed into the charge of some
responsible persons, whose names I have forgot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gebbie was the name,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and there is no
doubt that Mr. Gebbie should have gone ashore with her
at Helvoet. But he did not, Mr. Drummond; and I think
you might praise God that I was there to offer in his
place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall have a word to say to Mr. Gebbie before long,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;As for yourself, I think it might have occurred
that you were somewhat young for such a post.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the choice was not between me and somebody
else, it was between me and nobody,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Nobody
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248"></a>248</span>
offered in my place, and I must say I think you show a very
small degree of gratitude to me that did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall wait until I understand my obligation a little
more in the particular,&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, and I think it stares you in the face, then,&rdquo;
said I. &ldquo;Your child was deserted, she was clean flung
away in the midst of Europe, with scarce two shillings,
and not two words of any language spoken there: I must
say, a bonny business! I brought her to this place. I gave
her the name and the tenderness due to a sister. All this
has not gone without expense, but that I scarce need to
hint at. They were services due to the young lady&rsquo;s character
which I respect; and I think it would be a bonny
business too, if I was to be singing her praises to her father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a young man,&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I hear you tell me,&rdquo; said I, with a good deal of heat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a very young man,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;or you
would have understood the significancy of the step.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you speak very much at your ease,&rdquo; cried I.
&ldquo;What else was I to do? It is a fact I might have hired
some decent, poor woman to be a third to us, and I declare
I never thought of it until this moment! But where was
I to find her, that am a foreigner myself? And let me
point out to your observation, Mr. Drummond, that it
would have cost me money out of my pocket. For here is
just what it comes to, that I had to pay through the nose
for your neglect; and there is only the one story to it, just
that you were so unloving and so careless as to have lost
your daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He that lives in a glass house should not be casting
stones,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;and we will finish inquiring into the
behaviour of Miss Drummond before we go on to sit in
judgment on her father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I will be entrapped into no such attitude,&rdquo; said
I. &ldquo;The character of Miss Drummond is far above inquiry,
as her father ought to know. So is mine, and I am
telling you that. There are but the two ways of it open.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249"></a>249</span>
The one is to express your thanks to me as one gentleman
to another, and to say no more. The other (if you are so
difficult as to be still dissatisfied) is to pay me that which
I have expended and be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He seemed to soothe me with a hand in the air. &ldquo;There,
there,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You go too fast, you go too fast, Mr.
Balfour. It is a good thing that I have learned to be more
patient. And I believe you forget that I have yet to see
my daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I began to be a little relieved upon this speech and a
change in the man&rsquo;s manner that I spied in him as soon as
the name of money fell between us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was thinking it would be more fit&mdash;if you will excuse
the plainness of my dressing in your presence&mdash;that
I should go forth and leave you to encounter her alone?&rdquo;
said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I would have looked for at your hands!&rdquo;
says he; and there was no mistake but what he said it
civilly.</p>

<p>I thought this better and better still, and as I began
to pull on my hose, recalling the man&rsquo;s impudent mendicancy
at Prestongrange&rsquo;s, I determined to pursue what
seemed to be my victory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you have any mind to stay some while in Leyden,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;this room is very much at your disposal, and I can
easy find another for myself: in which way we shall have
the least amount of flitting possible, there being only one
to change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; said he, making his bosom big, &ldquo;I think
no shame of a poverty I have come by in the service of my
king; I make no secret that my affairs are quite involved:
and, for the moment, it would be even impossible for me
to undertake a journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Until you have occasion to communicate with your
friends,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;perhaps it might be convenient for you
(as of course it would be honourable to myself) if you were
to regard yourself in the light of my guest?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page250"></a>250</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when an offer is frankly made, I think
I honour myself most to imitate that frankness. Your
hand, Mr. David; you have the character that I respect the
most; you are one of those from whom a gentleman can
take a favour and no more words about it. I am an old
soldier,&rdquo; he went on, looking rather disgusted-like around
my chamber, &ldquo;and you need not fear I shall prove burthensome.
I have ate too often at a dyke-side, drank of the
ditch, and had no roof but the rain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should be telling you,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that our breakfasts
are sent customarily in about this time of morning. I propose
I should go now to the tavern, and bid them add a
cover for yourself, and delay the meal the matter of an hour,
which will give you an interval to meet your daughter
in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Methought his nostrils wagged at this. &ldquo;O, an hour?&rdquo;
says he. &ldquo;That is perhaps superfluous. Half an hour,
Mr. David, or say twenty minutes; I shall do very well in
that. And by the way,&rdquo; he adds, detaining me by the
coat, &ldquo;what is it you drink in the morning, whether ale
or wine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be frank with you, sir,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;I drink nothing
else but spare, cold water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tut-tut,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that is fair destruction to the
stomach, take an old campaigner&rsquo;s word for it. Our country
spirit at home is perhaps the most entirely wholesome; but
as that is not come-at-able, Rhenish or a white wine of
Burgundy will be next best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall make it my business to see you are supplied,&rdquo;
said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, very good,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and we shall make a man
of you yet, Mr. David.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time I can hardly say that I was minding him
at all, beyond an odd thought of the kind of father-in-law
that he was like to prove; and all my cares centred about
the lass his daughter, to whom I determined to convey
some warning of her visitor. I stepped to the door accordingly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251"></a>251</span>
and cried through the panels, knocking thereon at
the same time: &ldquo;Miss Drummond, here is your father come
at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that I went forth upon my errand, having (by
two words) extraordinarily damaged my affairs.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page252"></a>252</span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVI</h3>

<h5>THE THREESOME</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Whether</span> or not I was to be so much blamed, or rather
perhaps pitied, I must leave others to judge. My shrewdness
(of which I have a good deal too) seems not so great
with the ladies. No doubt, at the moment when I awakened
her, I was thinking a good deal of the effect upon James
More; and similarly when I returned and we were all sat
down to breakfast, I continued to behave to the young lady
with deference and distance; as I still think to have been
most wise. Her father had cast doubts upon the innocence
of my friendship; and these, it was my first business to
allay. But there is a kind of an excuse for Catriona also.
We had shared in a scene of some tenderness and passion,
and given and received caresses; I had thrust her from me
with violence; I had called aloud upon her in the night
from the one room to the other: she had passed hours of
wakefulness and weeping; and it is not to be supposed
I had been absent from her pillow thoughts. Upon the
back of this, to be awaked with unaccustomed formality,
under the name of Miss Drummond, and to be thenceforth
used with a great deal of distance and respect, led her entirely
in error on my private sentiments; and she was indeed
so incredibly abused as to imagine me repentant and
trying to draw off!</p>

<p>The trouble betwixt us seems to have been this: that
whereas I (since I had first set eyes on his great hat) thought
singly of James More, his return and suspicions, she made
so little of these that I may say she scarce remarked them,
and all her troubles and doings regarded what had passed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253"></a>253</span>
between us in the night before. This is partly to be explained
by the innocence and boldness of her character;
and partly because James More, having sped so ill in his
interview with me, or had his mouth closed by my invitation,
said no word to her upon the subject. At the breakfast,
accordingly, it soon appeared we were at cross-purposes.
I had looked to find her in clothes of her own: I found her
(as if her father were forgotten) wearing some of the best
that I had bought for her, and which she knew (or thought)
that I admired her in. I had looked to find her imitate
my affectation of distance, and be most precise and formal;
instead, I found her flushed and wild-like, with eyes extraordinary
bright, and a painful and varying expression,
calling me by name with a sort of appeal of tenderness, and
referring and deferring to my thoughts and wishes like an
anxious or a suspected wife.</p>

<p>But this was not for long. As I beheld her so regardless
of her own interests, which I had jeopardised and was
now endeavouring to recover, I redoubled my own coldness
in the manner of a lesson to the girl. The more she came
forward, the further I drew back; the more she betrayed
the closeness of our intimacy, the more pointedly civil I
became, until even her father (if he had not been so engrossed
with eating) might have observed the opposition. In the
midst of which, of a sudden, she became wholly changed,
and I told myself, with a good deal of relief, that she had
took the hint at last.</p>

<p>All day I was at my classes or in quest of my new
lodging; and though the hour of our customary walk hung
miserably on my hands, I cannot say but I was happy on
the whole to find my way cleared, the girl again in proper
keeping, the father satisfied, or at least acquiescent, and
myself free to prosecute my love with honour. At supper,
as at all our meals, it was James More that did the talking.
No doubt but he talked well, if any one could have believed
him. But I will speak of him presently more at large.
The meal at an end, he rose, got his great-coat, and looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254"></a>254</span>
(as I thought) at me, observed he had affairs abroad. I
took this for a hint that I was to be going also, and got up;
whereupon the girl, who had scarce given me greeting at
my entrance, turned her eyes on me wide open, with a look
that bade me stay. I stood between them like a fish out
of water, turning from one to the other; neither seemed
to observe me, she gazing on the floor, he buttoning
his coat: which vastly swelled my embarrassment. This
appearance of indifference argued, upon her side, a good
deal of anger very near to burst out. Upon his, I thought
it horribly alarming; I made sure there was a tempest
brewing there; and considering that to be the chief peril,
turned towards him and put myself (so to speak) in the
man&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I do anything for <i>you</i>, Mr. Drummond?&rdquo; says I.</p>

<p>He stifled a yawn, which again I thought to be duplicity.
&ldquo;Why, Mr. David,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;since you are so obliging as
to propose it, you might show me the way to a certain
tavern&rdquo; (of which he gave the name) &ldquo;where I hope to
fall in with some old companions in arms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no more to say, and I got my hat and cloak
to bear him company.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And as for you,&rdquo; says he to his daughter, &ldquo;you had
best go to your bed. I shall be late home, and <i>Early to
bed and early to rise, gars bonny lasses have bright
eyes</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whereupon he kissed her with a good deal of tenderness,
and ushered me before him from the door. This was so
done (I thought on purpose) that it was scarce possible
there should be any parting salutation; but I observed
she did not look at me, and set it down to terror of James
More.</p>

<p>It was some distance to that tavern. He talked all the
way of matters which did not interest me the smallest, and
at the door dismissed me with empty manners. Thence
I walked to my new lodging, where I had not so much as
a chimney to hold me warm, and no society but my own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255"></a>255</span>
thoughts. These were still bright enough; I did not so
much as dream that Catriona was turned against me; I
thought we were like folk pledged; I thought we had been
too near and spoke too warmly to be severed, least of all by
what were only steps in a most needful policy. And the
chief of my concern was only the kind of father-in-law that
I was getting, which was not at all the kind I would have
chosen; and the matter of how soon I ought to speak to
him, which was a delicate point on several sides. In the
first place, when I thought how young I was, I blushed all
over, and could almost have found it in my heart to have
desisted; only that if once I let them go from Leyden without
explanation, I might lose her altogether. And in the
second place, there was our very irregular situation to be
kept in view, and the rather scant measure of satisfaction
I had given James More that morning. I concluded, on
the whole, that delay would not hurt anything, yet I could
not delay too long neither; and got to my cold bed with a
full heart.</p>

<p>The next day, as James More seemed a little on the
complaining hand in the matter of my chamber, I offered
to have in more furniture; and coming in the afternoon,
with porters bringing chairs and tables, found the girl once
more left to herself. She greeted me on my admission
civilly, but withdrew at once to her own room, of which
she shut the door. I made my disposition, and paid and
dismissed the men so that she might hear them go, when I
supposed she would at once come forth again to speak to
me. I waited yet a while, then knocked upon her door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catriona!&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>The door was opened so quickly, even before I had the
word out, that I thought she must have stood behind it
listening. She remained there in the interval quite still;
but she had a look that I cannot put a name on, as of one
in a bitter trouble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we not to have our walk to-day either?&rdquo; so I
faltered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page256"></a>256</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am thanking you,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I will not be caring
much to walk now that my father is come home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I think he has gone out himself and left you here
alone,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do you think that was very kindly said?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not unkindly meant,&rdquo; I replied.&mdash;&ldquo;What ails
you, Catriona? What have I done to you that you should
turn from me like this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not turn from you at all,&rdquo; she said, speaking very
carefully. &ldquo;I will ever be grateful to my friend that was
good to me; I will ever be his friend in all that I am able.
But now that my father James More is come again, there is
a difference to be made, and I think there are some things
said and done that would be better to be forgotten. But
I will ever be your friend in all that I am able, and if that
is not all that ... if it is not so much.... Not that you
will be caring! But I would not have you think of me too
hard. It was true what you said to me, that I was too
young to be advised, and I am hoping you will remember
I was just a child. I would not like to lose your friendship,
at all events.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She began this very pale; but before she was done the
blood was in her face like scarlet, so that not her words only,
but her face and the trembling of her very hands, besought
me to be gentle. I saw, for the first time, how very wrong
I had done to place the child in that position, where she had
been entrapped into a moment&rsquo;s weakness, and now stood
before me like a person shamed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Drummond,&rdquo; I said, and stuck, and made the
same beginning once again, &ldquo;I wish you could see into my
heart,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;You would read there that my respect
is undiminished. If that were possible, I should say it was
increased. This is but the result of the mistake we made;
and had to come; and the less said of it now the better.
Of all of our life here, I promise you it shall never pass my
lips; I would like to promise you too that I would never think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257"></a>257</span>
of it, but it&rsquo;s a memory that will be always dear to me. And
as for a friend, you have one here that would die for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am thanking you,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>We stood a while silent, and my sorrow for myself began
to get the upper hand; for here were all my dreams come
to a sad tumble, and my love lost, and myself alone again
in the world, as at the beginning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we shall be friends always, that&rsquo;s a
certain thing. But this is a kind of a farewell too: it&rsquo;s a kind
of a farewell after all; I shall always ken Miss Drummond,
but this is a farewell to my Catriona.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked at her; I could hardly say I saw her, but she
seemed to grow great and brighten in my eyes; and with
that I suppose I must have lost my head, for I called out
her name again and made a step at her with my hands
reached forth.</p>

<p>She shrank back like a person struck, her face flamed;
but the blood sprang no faster up into her cheeks than
what it flowed back upon my own heart, at sight of it, with
penitence and concern. I found no words to excuse myself,
but bowed before her very deep, and went my ways out
of the house with death in my bosom.</p>

<p>I think it was about five days that followed without
any change. I saw her scarce ever but at meals, and then
of course in the company of James More. If we were alone,
even for a moment, I made it my devoir to behave the
more distantly and to multiply respectful attentions, having
always in my mind&rsquo;s eye that picture of the girl shrinking
and flaming in a blush, and in my heart more pity for her
than I could depict in words. I was sorry enough for myself,
I need not dwell on that, having fallen all my length
and more than all my height in a few seconds; but, indeed,
I was near as sorry for the girl, and sorry enough to be scarce
angry with her save by fits and starts. Her plea was good:
she was but a child; she had been placed in an unfair position;
if she had deceived herself and me, it was no more
than was to have been looked for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page258"></a>258</span></p>

<p>And, for another thing, she was now very much alone.
Her father, when he was by, was rather a caressing parent;
but he was very easy led away by his affairs and pleasures,
neglected her without compunction or remark, spent his
nights in taverns when he had the money, which was more
often than I could at all account for; and even in the course
of these few days, failed once to come to a meal, which
Catriona and I were at last compelled to partake of without
him. It was the evening meal, and I left immediately that
I had eaten, observing I supposed she would prefer to be
alone; to which she agreed, and (strange as it may seem) I
quite believed her. Indeed, I thought myself but an eyesore
to the girl, and a reminder of a moment&rsquo;s weakness that
she now abhorred to think of. So she must sit alone in
that room where she and I had been so merry, and in the
blink of that chimney whose light had shone upon our many
difficult and tender moments. There she must sit alone,
and think of herself as of a maid who had most unmaidenly
proffered her affections and had the same rejected. And
in the meanwhile I would be alone in some other place, and
reading myself (whenever I was tempted to be angry)
lessons upon human frailty and female delicacy. And
altogether I suppose there were never two poor fools
made themselves more unhappy in a greater misconception.</p>

<p>As for James, he paid not so much heed to us, or to anything
in nature but his pocket, and his belly, and his own
prating talk. Before twelve hours were gone he had raised
a small loan of me; before thirty, he had asked for a second,
and been refused. Money and refusal he took with the
same kind of high good-nature. Indeed, he had an outside
air of magnanimity that was very well fitted to impose upon
a daughter; and the light in which he was constantly presented
in his talk, and the man&rsquo;s fine presence and great
ways, went together pretty harmoniously. So that a man
that had no business with him, and either very little penetration
or a furious deal of prejudice, might almost have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259"></a>259</span>
been taken in. To me, after my first two interviews, he
was as plain as print; I saw him to be perfectly selfish, with
a perfect innocency in the same; and I would hearken to
his swaggering talk (of arms, and &ldquo;an old soldier,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;a poor Highland gentleman,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the strength of my
country and my friends&rdquo;) as I might to the babbling of a
parrot.</p>

<p>The odd thing was that I fancy he believed some part
of it himself, or did at times; I think he was so false all
through that he scarce knew when he was lying; and for
one thing, his moments of dejection must have been wholly
genuine. There were times when he would be the most
silent, affectionate, clinging creature possible, holding
Catriona&rsquo;s hand like a big baby, and begging of me not to
leave if I had any love to him; of which, indeed, I had none,
but all the more to his daughter. He would press, and
indeed beseech us to entertain him with our talk&mdash;a thing
very difficult in the state of our relations; and again break
forth in pitiable regrets for his own land and friends, or into
Gaelic singing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is one of the melancholy airs of my native land,&rdquo;
he would say. &ldquo;You may think it strange to see a soldier
weep, and indeed it is to make a near friend of you,&rdquo; says
he. &ldquo;But the notes of this singing are in my blood, and
the words come out of my heart. And when I mind upon
my red mountains, and the wild birds calling there, and the
brave streams of water running down, I would scarce think
shame to weep before my enemies.&rdquo; Then he would sing
again, and translate to me pieces of the song, with a great
deal of boggling and much expressed contempt against the
English language. &ldquo;It says here,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;that
the sun is gone down, and the battle is at an end, and the
brave chiefs are defeated. And it tells here how the stars
see them fleeing into strange countries or lying dead on the
red mountain; and they will never more shout the call of
battle or wash their feet in the streams of the valley. But
if you had only some of this language, you would weep also,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260"></a>260</span>
because the words of it are beyond all expression, and it is
mere mockery to tell you it in English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, I thought there was a good deal of mockery in
the business, one way and another; and yet, there was
some feeling too, for which I hated him, I think, the worst
of all. And it used to cut me to the quick to see Catriona
so much concerned for the old rogue, and weeping herself
to see him weep, when I was sure one half of his distress
flowed from his last night&rsquo;s drinking in some tavern. There
were times when I was tempted to lend him a round sum,
and see the last of him for good; but this would have been
to see the last of Catriona as well, for which I was scarcely
so prepared; and besides, it went against my conscience to
squander my good money on one who was so little of a
husband.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVII</h3>

<h5>A TWOSOME</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">I believe</span> it was about the fifth day, and I know at least
that James was in one of his fits of gloom, when I received
three letters. The first was from Alan, offering to visit me
in Leyden; the other two were out of Scotland and
prompted by the same affair, which was the death of my
uncle and my own complete accession to my rights. Rankeillor&rsquo;s
was, of course, wholly in the business view; Miss
Grant&rsquo;s was like herself, a little more witty than wise, full
of blame to me for not having written (though how was I
to write with such intelligence?), and of rallying talk about
Catriona, which it cut me to the quick to read in her very
presence.</p>

<p>For it was of course in my own rooms that I found
them, when I came to dinner, so that I was surprised out
of my news in the very first moment of reading it. This
made a welcome diversion for all three of us, nor could
any have foreseen the ill consequences that ensued. It
was accident that brought the three letters the same day,
and that gave them into my hand in the same room with
James More; and of all the events that flowed from that
accident, and which I might have prevented if I had held
my tongue, the truth is that they were preordained before
Agricola came into Scotland or Abraham set out upon his
travels.</p>

<p>The first that I opened was naturally Alan&rsquo;s: and what
more natural than that I should comment on his design to
visit me? but I observed James to sit up with an air of
immediate attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page262"></a>262</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that not Alan Breck that was suspected of the
Appin accident?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>I told him, &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; it was the same; and he withheld
me some time from my other letters, asking of our acquaintance,
of Alan&rsquo;s manner of life in France, of which I knew
very little, and further of his visit as now proposed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All we forfeited folk hang a little together,&rdquo; he explained,
&ldquo;and besides, I know the gentleman: and though
his descent is not the thing, and indeed he has no true right
to use the name of Stewart, he was very much admired in
the day of Drummossie. He did there like a soldier; if
some that need not be named had done as well, the upshot
need not have been so melancholy to remember. There
were two that did their best that day, and it makes a bond
between the pair of us,&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p>I could scarce refrain from shooting out my tongue at
him, and could almost have wished that Alan had been
there to have inquired a little further into that mention of
his birth. Though, they tell me, the same was indeed not
wholly regular.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I had opened Miss Grant&rsquo;s, and could not
withhold an exclamation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catriona,&rdquo; I cried, forgetting, the first time since her
father was arrived, to address her by a handle, &ldquo;I am come
into my kingdom fairly, I am the laird of Shaws indeed&mdash;my
uncle is dead at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She clapped her hands together, leaping from her seat.
The next moment it must have come over both of us at
once what little cause of joy was left to either, and we
stood opposite, staring on each other sadly.</p>

<p>But James showed himself a ready hypocrite. &ldquo;My
daughter,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;is this how my cousin learned you to
behave? Mr. David has lost a near friend, and we should
first condole with him on his bereavement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Troth, sir,&rdquo; said I, turning to him in a kind of anger,
&ldquo;I can make no such faces. His death is as blithe news
as ever I got.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page263"></a>263</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good soldier&rsquo;s philosophy,&rdquo; says James. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
the way of flesh, we must all go, all go. And if the gentleman
was so far from your favour, why, very well! But we
may at least congratulate you on your accession to your
estates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor can I say that either,&rdquo; I replied, with the same
heat. &ldquo;It is a good estate; what matters that to a lone
man that has enough already? I had a good revenue
before in my frugality; and but for the man&rsquo;s death&mdash;which
gratifies me, shame to me that must confess it!&mdash;I see not
how any one is to be bettered by this change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are more affected than
you let on, or you would never make yourself out so lonely.
Here are three letters; that means three that wish you
well; and I could name two more here in this very chamber.
I have known you not so very long, but Catriona, when
we are alone, is never done with the singing of your praises.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked up at him, a little wild at that; and he slid
off at once into another matter, the extent of my estate,
which (during the most of the dinner time) he continued
to dwell upon with interest. But it was to no purpose he
dissembled; he had touched the matter with too gross a
hand: and I knew what to expect. Dinner was scarce ate
when he plainly discovered his designs. He reminded
Catriona of an errand, and bid her attend to it. &ldquo;I do not
see you should be gone beyond the hour,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and
friend David will be good enough to bear me company till
you return.&rdquo; She made haste to obey him without words.
I do not know if she understood,&mdash;I believe not; but I was
completely satisfied, and sat strengthening my mind for
what should follow.</p>

<p>The door had scarce closed behind her departure, when
the man leaned back in his chair and addressed me with
a good affectation of easiness. Only the one thing betrayed
him, and that was his face, which suddenly shone all over
with fine points of sweat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am rather glad to have a word alone with you,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264"></a>264</span>
says he, &ldquo;because in our first interview there was some
expressions you misapprehended, and I have long meant
to set you right upon. My daughter stands beyond doubt.
So do you, and I would make that good with my sword
against all gainsayers. But, my dear David, this world
is a censorious place&mdash;as who should know it better than
myself, who have lived ever since the days of my late departed
father, God sain him! in a perfect spate of calumnies?
We have to face to that; you and me have to consider of
that; we have to consider of that.&rdquo; And he wagged his
head like a minister in a pulpit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To what effect, Mr. Drummond?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I would
be obliged to you if you would approach your point.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; says he, laughing, &ldquo;like your character
indeed! and what I most admire in it. But the point, my
worthy fellow, is sometimes in a kittle bit.&rdquo; He filled a
glass of wine. &ldquo;Though between you and me, that are
such fast friends, it need not bother us long. The point,
I need scarcely tell you, is my daughter. And the first
thing is that I have no thought in my mind of blaming you.
In the unfortunate circumstances, what could you do else?
&rsquo;Deed, and I cannot tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you for that,&rdquo; said I, pretty close upon my
guard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have besides studied your character,&rdquo; he went on;
&ldquo;your talents are fair; you seem to have a moderate competence,
which does no harm; and, one thing with another,
I am very happy to have to announce to you that I have
decided on the latter of the two ways open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I am dull,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;What ways are
these?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He bent his brows upon me formidably and uncrossed
his legs. &ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I think I need scarce
describe them to a gentleman of your condition: either
that I should cut your throat or that you should marry my
daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are pleased to be quite plain at last,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page265"></a>265</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And I believe I have been plain from the beginning!&rdquo;
cries he robustiously. &ldquo;I am a careful parent, Mr. Balfour;
but, I thank God, a patient and deleeberate man. There
is many a father, sir, that would have hirsled you at once
either to the altar or the field. My esteem for your character&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Drummond,&rdquo; I interrupted, &ldquo;if you have any
esteem for me at all, I will beg of you to moderate your
voice. It is quite needless to rowt at a gentleman in the
same chamber with yourself, and lending you his best
attention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, very true,&rdquo; says he, with an immediate change.
&ldquo;And you must excuse the agitations of a parent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand you then,&rdquo; I continued&mdash;&ldquo;for I will
take no note of your other alternative, which perhaps it
was a pity you let fall&mdash;I understand you rather to offer
me encouragement in case I should desire to apply for your
daughter&rsquo;s hand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not possible to express my meaning better,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;and I see we shall do well together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That remains to be yet seen,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;But so much
I need make no secret of, that I bear the lady you refer
to the most tender affection, and I could not fancy, even in
a dream, a better fortune than to get her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was sure of it, I felt certain of you, David,&rdquo; he cried,
and reached out his hand to me.</p>

<p>I put it by. &ldquo;You go too fast, Mr. Drummond,&rdquo; said
I. &ldquo;There are conditions to be made; and there is a
difficulty in the path, which I see not entirely how we shall
come over. I have told you that, upon my side, there is
no objection to the marriage, but I have good reason to
believe there will be much on the young lady&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is all beside the mark,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;I will engage
for her acceptance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you forget, Mr. Drummond,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that,
even in dealing with myself, you have been betrayed into
two-three unpalatable expressions. I will have none such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266"></a>266</span>
employed to the young lady. I am here to speak and think
for the two of us; and I give you to understand that I
would no more let a wife be forced upon myself than what
I would let a husband be forced on the young lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sat and glowered at me like one in doubt and a good
deal of temper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that this is to be the way of it,&rdquo; I concluded. &ldquo;I
will marry Miss Drummond, and that blithely, if she is
entirely willing. But if there be the least unwillingness,
as I have reason to fear&mdash;marry her will I never.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is a small affair. As soon
as she returns I will sound her a bit, and hope to reassure
you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But I cut in again. &ldquo;Not a finger of you, Mr. Drummond,
or I cry off, and you can seek a husband to your
daughter somewhere else,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It is I that am to be
the only dealer and the only judge. I shall satisfy myself
exactly; and none else shall anyways meddle&mdash;you the
least of all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, sir!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;and who are
you to be the judge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bridegroom, I believe,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is to quibble,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You turn your back
upon the facts. The girl, my daughter, has no choice left
to exercise. Her character is gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I ask your pardon,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but while this matter
lies between her and you and me, that is not so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What security have I?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Am I to let my
daughter&rsquo;s reputation depend upon a chance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have thought of all this long ago,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;before you were so misguided as to lose her; and not afterwards,
when it is quite too late. I refuse to regard myself
as any way accountable for your neglect, and I will be brow-beat
by no man living. My mind is quite made up, and,
come what may, I will not depart from it a hair&rsquo;s-breadth.
You and me are to sit here in company till her return; upon
which, without either word or look from you, she and I are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267"></a>267</span>
to go forth again to hold our talk. If she can satisfy me
that she is willing to this step, I will then make it; and if she
cannot, I will not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He leaped out of his seat like a man stung. &ldquo;I can spy
your man&oelig;uvre,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;you would work upon her to
refuse!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe ay, and maybe no,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;That is the way
it is to be, whatever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if I refuse?&rdquo; cries he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, Mr. Drummond, it will have to come to the
throat-cutting,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>What with the size of the man, his great length of arm,
in which he came near rivalling his father, and his reputed
skill at weapons, I did not use this word without some
trepidation, to say nothing at all of the circumstance that
he was Catriona&rsquo;s father. But I might have spared myself
alarms. From the poorness of my lodging&mdash;he does not seem
to have remarked his daughter&rsquo;s dresses, which were indeed
all equally new to him,&mdash;and from the fact that I had shown
myself averse to lend, he had embraced a strong idea of my
poverty. The sudden news of my estate convinced him of his
error, and he had made but the one bound of it on this
fresh venture, to which he was now so wedded, that I believe
he would have suffered anything rather than fall to the
alternative of fighting.</p>

<p>A little while longer he continued to dispute with me,
until I hit upon a word that silenced him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I find you so averse to let me see the lady by herself,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;I must suppose you have very good grounds to
think me in the right about her unwillingness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gabbled some kind of an excuse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But all this is very exhausting to both of our tempers,&rdquo;
I added, &ldquo;and I think we would do better to preserve a
judicious silence.&rdquo;

The which we did until the girl returned, and I must
suppose would have cut a very ridiculous figure had there
been any there to view us.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII</h3>

<h5>IN WHICH I AM LEFT ALONE</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">I opened</span> the door to Catriona and stopped her on the
threshold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father wishes us to take our walk,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>She looked at James More, who nodded, and at that, like
a trained soldier, she turned to go with me.</p>

<p>We took one of our old ways, where we had gone often
together, and been more happy than I can tell of in the past.
I came a half a step behind, so that I could watch her unobserved.
The knocking of her little shoes upon the way
sounded extraordinary pretty and sad; and I thought it a
strange moment that I should be so near both ends of it at
once, and walk in the midst between two destinies, and could
not tell whether I was hearing these steps for the last time,
or whether the sound of them was to go in and out with me
till death should part us.</p>

<p>She avoided even to look at me, only walked before her,
like one who had a guess of what was coming. I saw I must
speak soon before my courage was run out, but where to
begin I knew not. In this painful situation, when the girl
was as good as forced into my arms, and had already besought
my forbearance, any excess of pressure must have
seemed indecent; yet to avoid it wholly would have a very
cold-like appearance. Between these extremes I stood helpless,
and could have bit my fingers; so that, when at last I
managed to speak at all, it may be said I spoke at random.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catriona,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am in a very painful situation;
or rather, so we are both; and I would be a good deal
obliged to you if you would promise to let me speak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269"></a>269</span>
through first of all, and not to interrupt till I have
done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She promised me that simply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;this that I have got to say is very
difficult, and I know very well I have no right to be saying it.
After what passed between the two of us last Friday, I have
no manner of right. We have got so ravelled up (and all
by my fault) that I know very well the least I could do is
just to hold my tongue, which was what I intended fully,
and there was nothing further from my thoughts than to
have troubled you again. But, my dear, it has become
merely necessary, and no way by it. You see, this estate of
mine has fallen in, which makes of me rather a better match;
and the&mdash;the business would not have quite the same
ridiculous-like appearance that it would before. Besides
which, it&rsquo;s supposed that our affairs have got so much
ravelled up (as I was saying) that it would be better to let
them be the way they are. In my view, this part of the
thing is vastly exaggerate, and if I were you I would not
ware two thoughts on it. Only it&rsquo;s right I should mention
the same, because there&rsquo;s no doubt it has some influence
on James More. Then I think we were none so unhappy
when we dwelt together in this town before. I think we
did pretty well together. If you would look back, my
dear&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will look neither back nor forward,&rdquo; she interrupted.
&ldquo;Tell me the one thing: this is my father&rsquo;s doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He approves of it,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;He approved that I
should ask your hand in marriage,&rdquo; and was going on again
with somewhat more of an appeal upon her feelings; but she
marked me not, and struck into the midst.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He told you to!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;It is no sense denying
it, you said yourself that there was nothing further from
your thoughts. He told you to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He spoke of it the first, if that is what you mean,&rdquo; I
began.</p>

<p>She was walking ever the faster, and looking fair in front
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270"></a>270</span>
of her; but at this she made a little noise in her head, and I
thought she would have run.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without which,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;after what you said last
Friday, I would never have been so troublesome as make the
offer. But when he as good as asked me, what was I to
do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stopped and turned round upon me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it is refused, at all events,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and there
will be an end of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she began again to walk forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I could expect no better,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I
think you might try to be a little kind to me for the last end
of it. I see not why you should be harsh. I have loved you
very well, Catriona&mdash;no harm that I should call you so for
the last time. I have done the best that I could manage, I
am trying the same still, and only vexed that I can do no
better. It is a strange thing to me that you can take any
pleasure to be hard to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not thinking of you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am thinking
of that man, my father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and that way too!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I can be of use
to you that way too; I will have to be. It is very needful,
my dear, that we should consult about your father; for the
way this talk has gone, an angry man will be James More.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stopped again. &ldquo;It is because I am disgraced?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is what he is thinking,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but I have
told you already to make naught of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be all one to me,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I prefer to be
disgraced!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did not know very well what to answer, and stood
silent.</p>

<p>There seemed to be something working in her bosom
after that last cry; presently she broke out, &ldquo;And what is
the meaning of all this? Why is all this shame loundered
on my head? How could you dare it, David Balfour?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what else was I to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page271"></a>271</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not your dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I defy you to be
calling me these words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not thinking of my words,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;My heart
bleeds for you, Miss Drummond. Whatever I may say, be
sure you have my pity in your difficult position. But there
is just the one thing that I wish you would bear in view, if it
was only long enough to discuss it quietly; for there is
going to be a collieshangie when we two get home. Take
my word for it, it will need the two of us to make this matter
end in peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said she. There sprang a patch of red in either
of her cheeks. &ldquo;Was he for fighting you?&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he was that,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>She gave a dreadful kind of laugh. &ldquo;At all events, it is
complete!&rdquo; she cried. And then turning on me: &ldquo;My
father and I are a fine pair,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but I am thanking
the good God there will be somebody worse than what we
are. I am thanking the good God that He has let me see
you so. There will never be the girl made that would not
scorn you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had borne a good deal pretty patiently, but this was
over the mark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have no right to speak to me like that,&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;What have I done but to be good to you, or try to be?
And here is my repayment! O, it is too much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She kept looking at me with a hateful smile.
&ldquo;Coward!&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The word in your throat and in your father&rsquo;s!&rdquo; I cried.
&ldquo;I have dared him this day already in your interest. I will
dare him again, the nasty pole-cat; little I care which of us
should fall! Come,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;back to the house with us;
let us be done with it, let me be done with the whole Hieland
crew of you! You will see what you think when I am
dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head at me with that same smile I could
have struck her for.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, smile away!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;I have seen your bonny
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272"></a>272</span>
father smile on the wrong side this day. Not that I mean
he was afraid, of course,&rdquo; I added hastily, &ldquo;but he preferred
the other way of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I offered to draw with him,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You offered to draw upon James More?&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I did so,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and found him backward
enough, or how would we be here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a meaning upon this,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;What is it
you are meaning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was to make you take me,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;and I
would not have it. I said you should be free, and I must
speak with you alone; little I supposed it would be such a
speaking! <i>And what if I refuse?</i> says he.&mdash;<i>Then it must
come to the throat-cutting</i>, says I, <i>for I will no more have a
husband forced on that young lady than what I would have
a wife forced upon myself</i>. These were my words, they were a
friend&rsquo;s words; bonnily have I been paid for them! Now
you have refused me of your own clear free will, and there
lives no father in the Highlands, or out of them, that can
force on this marriage. I will see that your wishes are respected;
I will make the same my business, as I have all
through. But I think you might have that decency as to
affect some gratitude. &rsquo;Deed, and I thought you knew me
better! I have not behaved quite well to you, but that was
weakness. And to think me a coward, and such a coward as
that&mdash;O my lass, there was a stab for the last of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Davie, how would I guess?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;O, this is a
dreadful business! Me and mine&rdquo;&mdash;she gave a kind of
wretched cry at the word,&mdash;&ldquo;me and mine are not fit to
speak to you. O, I could be kneeling down to you in the
street, I could be kissing your hands for your forgiveness!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will keep the kisses I have got from you already,&rdquo;
cried I. &ldquo;I will keep the ones I wanted and that were something
worth; I will not be kissed in penitence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can you be thinking of this miserable girl?&rdquo;
says she.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page273"></a>273</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What I am trying to tell you all this while!&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;that you had best leave me alone, whom you can make no
more unhappy if you tried, and turn your attention to
James More, your father, with whom you are like to have a
queer pirn to wind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, that I must be going out into the world alone with
such a man!&rdquo; she cried, and seemed to catch herself in with
a great effort. &ldquo;But trouble yourself no more for that,&rdquo;
said she. &ldquo;He does not know what kind of nature is in my
heart. He will pay me dear for this day of it; dear, dear
will he pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned, and began to go home, and I to accompany
her. At which she stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will be going alone,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is alone I must
be seeing him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some little while I raged about the streets, and told
myself I was the worst-used lad in Christendom. Anger
choked me; it was all very well for me to breathe deep; it
seemed there was not air enough about Leyden to supply
me, and I thought I would have burst like a man at the
bottom of the sea. I stopped and laughed at myself at
a street-corner a minute together, laughing out loud, so
that a passenger looked at me, which brought me to
myself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;I have been a gull and a ninny and
a soft Tommy long enough. Time it was done. Here is a
good lesson to have nothing to do with that accursed sex,
that was the ruin of the man in the beginning, and will be so
to the end. God knows I was happy enough before ever I
saw her; God knows I can be happy enough again when
I have seen the last of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That seemed to me the chief affair: to see them go. I
dwelled upon the idea fiercely; and presently slipped on,
in a kind of malevolence, to consider how very poorly they
were like to fare when David Balfour was no longer by to
be their milk-cow; at which, to my own very great surprise,
the disposition of my mind turned bottom up. I was still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274"></a>274</span>
angry; I still hated her; and yet I thought I owed it to
myself that she should suffer nothing.</p>

<p>This carried me home again at once, where I found the
mails drawn out and ready fastened by the door, and the
father and daughter with every mark upon them of a recent
disagreement. Catriona was like a wooden doll; James
More breathed hard, his face was dotted with white spots,
and his nose upon one side. As soon as I came in, the girl
looked at him with a steady, clear, dark look that might very
well have been followed by a blow. It was a hint that was
more contemptuous than a command, and I was surprised
to see James More accept it. It was plain he had had
a master talking-to; and I could see there must be more
of the devil in the girl than I had guessed, and more good-humour
about the man than I had given him the credit of.</p>

<p>He began, at least, calling me Mr. Balfour, and plainly
speaking from a lesson; but he got not very far, for at the
first pompous swell of his voice Catriona cut in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you what James More is meaning,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;He means we have come to you, beggar-folk, and have not
behaved to you very well, and we are ashamed of our ingratitude
and ill-behaviour. Now we are wanting to go
away and be forgotten; and my father will have guided his
gear so ill, that we cannot even do that unless you will give
us some more alms. For that is what we are, at all events,
beggar-folk and sorners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By your leave, Miss Drummond,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I must
speak to your father by myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went into her own room and shut the door, without
a word or a look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must excuse her, Mr. Balfour,&rdquo; says James More.
&ldquo;She has no delicacy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not here to discuss that with you,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but
to be quit of you. And to that end I must talk of your
position. Now, Mr. Drummond, I have kept the run
of your affairs more closely than you bargained for. I
know you had money of your own when you were borrowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275"></a>275</span>
mine. I know you have had more since you were here in
Leyden, though you concealed it even from your daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bid you beware. I will stand no more baiting,&rdquo; he
broke out. &ldquo;I am sick of her and you. What kind of a
damned trade is this to be a parent! I have had expressions
used to me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; There he broke off. &ldquo;Sir, this is the
heart of a soldier and a parent,&rdquo; he went on again, laying his
hand on his bosom, &ldquo;outraged in both characters&mdash;and I
bid you beware.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you would have let me finish,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;you would
have found I spoke for your advantage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I know I might have relied
upon the generosity of your character.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man! will you let me speak?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;The fact is
that I cannot win to find out if you are rich or poor. But it
is my idea that your means, as they are mysterious in their
source, so they are something insufficient in amount; and I
do not choose your daughter to be lacking. If I durst speak
to herself, you may be certain I would never dream of trusting
it to you; because I know you like the back of my hand,
and all your blustering talk is that much wind to me. However,
I believe in your way you do still care something for
your daughter after all; and I must just be doing with that
ground of confidence, such as it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whereupon I arranged with him that he was to communicate
with me, as to his whereabouts and Catriona&rsquo;s
welfare, in consideration of which I was to serve him a small
stipend.</p>

<p>He heard the business out with a great deal of eagerness;
and when it was done, &ldquo;My dear fellow, my dear son,&rdquo; he
cried out, &ldquo;this is more like yourself than any of it yet! I
will serve you with a soldier&rsquo;s faithfulness&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me hear no more of it!&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;You have got
me to that pitch that the bare name of soldier rises on my
stomach. Our traffic is settled; I am now going forth and
will return in one half-hour, when I expect to find my
chambers purged of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page276"></a>276</span></p>

<p>I gave them good measure of time; it was my one fear
that I might see Catriona again, because tears and weakness
were ready in my heart, and I cherished my anger like a
piece of dignity. Perhaps an hour went by; the sun had
gone down, a little wisp of a new moon was following it
across a scarlet sunset; already there were stars in the east,
and in my chambers, when at last I entered them, the night
lay blue. I lit a taper and reviewed the rooms; in the first
there remained nothing so much as to awake a memory of
those who were gone; but in the second, in a corner of the
floor, I spied a little heap that brought my heart into my
mouth. She had left behind at her departure all that ever
she had of me. It was the blow that I felt sorest, perhaps
because it was the last; and I fell upon that pile of clothing
and behaved myself more foolish than I care to tell of.</p>

<p>Late in the night, in a strict frost, and my teeth chattering,
I came again by some portion of my manhood and considered
with myself. The sight of these poor frocks and
ribbons, and her shifts, and the clocked stockings, was not
to be endured; and if I were to recover any constancy of
mind, I saw I must be rid of them ere the morning. It was
my first thought to have made a fire and burned them; but
my disposition has always been opposed to wastery, for one
thing; and for another, to have burned these things that she
had worn so close upon her body seemed in the nature of a
cruelty. There was a corner cupboard in that chamber;
there I determined to bestow them. The which I did, and
made it a long business, folding them with very little skill
indeed, but the more care; and sometimes dropping them
with my tears. All the heart was gone out of me, I was
weary as though I had run miles, and sore like one beaten;
when, as I was folding a kerchief that she wore often at her
neck, I observed there was a corner neatly cut from it. It
was a kerchief of a very pretty hue, on which I had frequently
remarked; and once that she had it on I remembered
telling her (by way of a banter) that she wore my
colours. There came a glow of hope and like a tide of sweetness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277"></a>277</span>
in my bosom; and the next moment I was plunged
back in a fresh despair. For there was the corner crumpled
in a knot, and cast down by itself in another part of the
floor.</p>

<p>But when I argued with myself I grew more hopeful.
She had cut that corner off in some childish freak that
was manifestly tender; that she had cast it away again was
little to be wondered at; and I was inclined to dwell more
upon the first than upon the second, and to be more pleased
that she had ever conceived the idea of that keepsake, than
concerned because she had flung it from her in an hour of
natural resentment.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIX</h3>

<h5>WE MEET IN DUNKIRK</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Altogether</span>, then, I was scarce so miserable the next days
but what I had many hopeful and happy snatches; threw
myself with a good deal of constancy upon my studies; and
made out to endure the time till Alan should arrive, or I
might hear word of Catriona by the means of James More.
I had altogether three letters in the time of our separation.
One was to announce their arrival in the town of Dunkirk in
France, from which place James shortly after started alone
upon a private mission. This was to England and to see
Lord Holderness; and it has always been a bitter thought
that my good money helped to pay the charges of the same.
But he has need of a long spoon who sups with the deil, or
James More either. During this absence, the time was to
fall due for another letter; and as the letter was the condition
of his stipend, he had been so careful as to prepare it
beforehand and leave it with Catriona to be despatched.
The fact of our correspondence aroused her suspicions, and
he was no sooner gone than she had burst the seal. What I
received began accordingly in the writing of James More:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your esteemed favour came to hand duly, and
I have to acknowledge the enclosure according to agreement. It
shall be all faithfully expended on my daughter, who is well, and
desires to be remembered to her dear friend, I find her in rather
a melancholy disposition, but trust in the mercy of God to see her
re-established. Our manner of life is very much alone, but we
solace ourselves with the melancholy tunes of our native mountains,
and by walking upon the margin of the sea that lies next to Scotland.
It was better days with me when I lay with five wounds upon my
body on the field of Gladsmuir. I have found employment here
in the <i>haras</i> of a French nobleman, where my experience is valued.
But, my dear Sir, the wages are so exceedingly unsuitable that I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279"></a>279</span>
would be ashamed to mention them, which makes your remittances
the more necessary to my daughter&rsquo;s comfort, though I daresay the
sight of old friends would be still better.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 13em;">&ldquo;My dear Sir,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 7em;">&ldquo;Your affectionate, obedient servant,</p>
<p class="rt">&ldquo;<span class="sc">James Macgregor Drummond</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">Below it began again in the hand of Catriona:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>&ldquo;Do not be believing him, it is all lies together.</p>

<p style="text-align: right; padding-right: 5em;">&ldquo;C. M. D.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Not only did she add this postscript, but I think she must
have come near suppressing the letter; for it came long after
date, and was closely followed by the third. In the time
betwixt them Alan had arrived, and made another life to
me with his merry conversation; I had been presented to
his cousin of the Scots-Dutch, a man that drank more than
I could have thought possible, and was not otherwise of
interest; I had been entertained to many jovial dinners, and
given some myself, all with no great change upon my sorrow;
and we two (by which I mean Alan and myself, and not at
all the cousin) had discussed a good deal the nature of my
relations with James More and his daughter. I was naturally
diffident to give particulars; and this disposition was
not anyway lessened by the nature of Alan&rsquo;s commentary
upon those I gave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I canna make head nor tail of it,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;but
it sticks in my mind ye&rsquo;ve made a gowk of yourself. There&rsquo;s
few people that has had more experience than Alan Breck;
and I can never call to mind to have heard tell of a lassie like
this one of yours. The way that you tell it, the thing&rsquo;s fair
impossible. Ye must have made a terrible hash of the
business, David.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are whiles that I am of the same mind,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The strange thing is that ye seem to have a kind of a
fancy for her too!&rdquo; said Alan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The biggest kind, Alan,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I think I&rsquo;ll take
it to my grave with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, ye beat me, whatever!&rdquo; he would conclude.</p>

<p>I showed him the letter with Catriona&rsquo;s postscript.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280"></a>280</span>
&ldquo;And here again!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Impossible to deny a kind
of decency to this Catriona, and sense forbye! As for
James More, the man&rsquo;s as boss as a drum; he&rsquo;s just a wame
and a wheen words; though I&rsquo;ll can never deny that he
fought reasonably well at Gladsmuir, and it&rsquo;s true what he
says here about the five wounds. But the loss of him is that
the man&rsquo;s boss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye see, Alan,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it goes against the grain with
me to leave the maid in such poor hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye couldna weel find poorer,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;But
what are ye to do with it? It&rsquo;s this way about a man and a
woman, ye see, Davie: the weemen-folk have got no kind of
reason to them. Either they like the man, and then a&rsquo; goes
fine; or else they just detest him, and ye may spare your
breath&mdash;ye can do naething. There&rsquo;s just the two sets of
them&mdash;them that would sell their coats for ye, and them
that never look the road ye&rsquo;re on. That&rsquo;s a&rsquo; that there is to
women; and you seem to be such a gomeril that ye canna
tell the tane frae the tither.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s true for me,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet there&rsquo;s naething easier!&rdquo; cried Alan. &ldquo;I
could easy learn ye the science of the thing; but ye seem to
me to be born blind, and there&rsquo;s where the deefficulty comes
in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And can <i>you</i> no&rsquo; help me?&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;you that&rsquo;s so
clever at the trade?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye see, David, I wasna here,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m like
a field officer that has naebody but blind men for scouts and
<i>éclaireurs</i>; and what would he ken? But it sticks in my
mind that ye&rsquo;ll have made some kind of bauchle; and if I
was you, I would have a try at her again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would ye so, man Alan?&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would e&rsquo;en&rsquo;t,&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p>The third letter came to my hand while we were deep in
some such talk; and it will be seen how pat it fell to the
occasion. James professed to be in some concern upon
his daughter&rsquo;s health, which I believe was never better;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281"></a>281</span>
abounded in kind expressions to myself; and finally proposed
that I should visit them at Dunkirk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will now be enjoying the society of my old comrade,
Mr. Stewart,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Why not accompany him
so far in his return to France? I have something very particular
for Mr. Stewart&rsquo;s ear; and, at any rate, I would be
pleased to meet in with an old fellow-soldier and one so
mettle as himself. As for you, my dear sir, my daughter
and I would be proud to receive our benefactor, whom we
regard as a brother and a son. The French nobleman has
proved a person of the most filthy avarice of character, and
I have been necessitate to leave the <i>haras</i>. You will find us,
in consequence, a little poorly lodged in the <i>auberge</i> of a man
Bazin on the dunes; but the situation is caller, and I make
no doubt but we might spend some very pleasant days,
when Mr. Stewart and I could recall our services, and you
and my daughter divert yourselves in a manner more befitting
your age. I beg at least that Mr. Stewart would
come here; my business with him opens a very wide door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does the man want with me?&rdquo; cried Alan when
he had read. &ldquo;What he wants with you is clear enough&mdash;it&rsquo;s
siller. But what can he want with Alan Breck?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, it&rsquo;ll be just an excuse,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;He is still after
this marriage, which I wish from my heart that we could
bring about. And he asks you because he thinks I would be
less likely to come wanting you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I wish that I kennt,&rdquo; says Alan. &ldquo;Him and me
were never onyways pack; we used to girn at ither like a pair
of pipers. &lsquo;Something for my ear,&rsquo; quo&rsquo; he! I&rsquo;ll maybe
have something for his hinder-end before we&rsquo;re through with
it. Dod, I&rsquo;m thinking it would be a kind of a divertisement
to gang and see what he&rsquo;ll be after! Forbye that I could see
your lassie then. What say ye, Davie? Will ye ride with
Alan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>You may be sure I was not backward, and, Alan&rsquo;s furlough
running towards an end, we set forth presently upon
this joint adventure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page282"></a>282</span></p>

<p>It was near dark of a January day when we rode at last
into the town of Dunkirk. We left our horses at the post,
and found a guide to Bazin&rsquo;s inn, which lay beyond the walls.
Night was quite fallen, so that we were the last to leave that
fortress, and heard the doors of it close behind us as we
passed the bridge. On the other side there lay a lighted
suburb, which we thridded for a while, then turned into a
dark lane, and presently found ourselves wading in the night
among deep sand where we could hear a bullering of the sea.
We travelled in this fashion for some while, following our
conductor mostly by the sound of his voice; and I had
begun to think he was perhaps misleading us, when we came
to the top of a small brae, and there appeared out of the
darkness a dim light in a window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Voilà l&rsquo;auberge à Bazin</i>,&rdquo; says the guide.</p>

<p>Alan smacked his lips. &ldquo;An unco lonely bit,&rdquo;
said he, and I thought by his tone he was not wholly
pleased.</p>

<p>A little after, and we stood in the lower story of that
house, which was all in the one apartment, with a stair leading
to the chambers at the side, benches and tables by the
wall, the cooking fire at the one end of it, and shelves of
bottles and the cellar-trap at the other. Here Bazin, who
was an ill-looking, big man, told us the Scottish gentleman
was gone abroad he knew not where, but the young lady
was above, and he would call her down to us.</p>

<p>I took from my breast that kerchief wanting the corner,
and knotted it about my throat. I could hear my heart go;
and, Alan patting me on the shoulder with some of his laughable
expressions, I could scarce refrain from a sharp word.
But the time was not long to wait. I heard her step pass
overhead, and saw her on the stair. This she descended
very quietly, and greeted me with a pale face and a certain
seeming of earnestness, or uneasiness, in her manner that
extremely dashed me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father, James More, will be here soon. He will be
very pleased to see you,&rdquo; she said. And then of a sudden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283"></a>283</span>
her face flamed, her eyes lightened, the speech stopped upon
her lips; and I made sure she had observed the kerchief.
It was only for a breath that she was discomposed; but methought
it was with a new animation that she turned to
welcome Alan. &ldquo;And you will be his friend Alan Breck?&rdquo;
she cried. &ldquo;Many is the dozen times I will have heard him
tell of you; and I love you already for all your bravery and
goodness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; says Alan, holding her hand in his and
viewing her, &ldquo;and so this is the young lady at the last of it!
David, you&rsquo;re an awful poor hand of a description.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I do not know that ever I heard him speak so straight to
people&rsquo;s hearts; the sound of his voice was like song.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? will he have been describing me?&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little else of it since I ever came out of France!&rdquo; says
he, &ldquo;forbye a bit of a speciment one night in Scotland in a
shaw of wood by Silvermills. But cheer up, my dear! ye&rsquo;re
bonnier than what he said. And now there&rsquo;s one thing
sure: you and me are to be a pair of friends. I&rsquo;m a kind of
a henchman to Davie here; I&rsquo;m like a tyke at his heels: and
whatever he cares for, I&rsquo;ve got to care for too&mdash;and by the
holy airn! they&rsquo;ve got to care for me! So now you can see
what way you stand with Alan Breck, and ye&rsquo;ll find ye&rsquo;ll
hardly lose on the transaction. He&rsquo;s no&rsquo; very bonny, my
dear, but he&rsquo;s leal to them he loves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you with my heart for your good words,&rdquo; said
she. &ldquo;I have that honour for a brave, honest man that I
cannot find any to be answering with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Using travellers&rsquo; freedom, we spared to wait for James
More, and sat down to meat, we threesome. Alan had
Catriona sit by him and wait upon his wants: he made her
drink first out of his glass, he surrounded her with continual
kind gallantries, and yet never gave me the most small
occasion to be jealous; and he kept the talk so much in his
own hand, and that in so merry a note, that neither she nor
I remembered to be embarrassed. If any had seen us there,
it must have been supposed that Alan was the old friend and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284"></a>284</span>
I the stranger. Indeed, I had often cause to love and to
admire the man, but I never loved or admired him better
than that night; and I could not help remarking to myself
(what I was sometimes rather in danger of forgetting) that
he had not only much experience of life, but in his own way
a great deal of natural ability besides. As for Catriona, she
seemed quite carried away; her laugh was like a peal of
bells, her face gay as a May morning; and I own, although
I was very well pleased, yet I was a little sad also, and
thought myself a dull, stockish character in comparison of
my friend, and very unfit to come into a young maid&rsquo;s life,
and perhaps ding down her gaiety.</p>

<p>But if that was like to be my part, I found at least that
I was not alone in it; for, James More returning suddenly,
the girl was changed into a piece of stone. Through the rest
of that evening, until she made an excuse and slipped to bed,
I kept an eye upon her without cease: and I can bear testimony
that she never smiled, scarce spoke, and looked
mostly on the board in front of her. So that I really marvelled
to see so much devotion (as it used to be) changed into
the very sickness of hate.</p>

<p>Of James More it is unnecessary to say much; you know
the man already, what there was to know of him; and I am
weary of writing out his lies. Enough that he drank a great
deal, and told us very little that was to any possible purpose.
As for the business with Alan, that was to be reserved for
the morrow and his private hearing.</p>

<p>It was the more easy to be put off, because Alan and I
were pretty weary with our day&rsquo;s ride, and sat not very late
after Catriona.</p>

<p>We were soon alone in a chamber where we were to make
shift with a single bed. Alan looked on me with a queer
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye muckle ass!&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do ye mean by that?&rdquo; I cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mean? What do I mean? It&rsquo;s extraordinar, David
man,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that you should be so mortal stupit.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page285"></a>285</span></p>

<p>Again I begged him to speak out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s this of it,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I told ye there were
the two kinds of women&mdash;them that would sell their shifts
for ye, and the others. Just you try for yoursel&rsquo;, my bonny
man.&mdash;But what&rsquo;s that neepkin at your craig?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thocht it was something thereabout,&rdquo; said he.

Nor would he say another word, though I besieged him
long with importunities.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXX</h3>

<h5>THE LETTER FROM THE SHIP</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Daylight</span> showed us how solitary the inn stood. It was
plainly hard upon the sea, yet out of all view of it, and beset
on every side with scabbit hills of sand. There was, indeed,
only one thing in the nature of a prospect, where there stood
out over a brae the two sails of a windmill, like an ass&rsquo;s ears,
but with the ass quite hidden. It was strange (after the
wind rose, for at first it was dead calm) to see the turning
and following of each other of these great sails behind the
hillock. Scarce any road came by there; but a number of
footways travelled among the bents in all directions up to
Mr. Bazin&rsquo;s door. The truth is, he was a man of many
trades, not any one of them honest, and the position of his
inn was the best of his livelihood. Smugglers frequented
it; political agents and forfeited persons bound across the
water came there to await their passages; and I daresay
there was worse behind, for a whole family might have been
butchered in that house and nobody the wiser.</p>

<p>I slept little and ill. Long ere it was day, I had slipped
from beside my bedfellow, and was warming myself at the
fire or walking to and fro before the door. Dawn broke
mighty sullen; but a little after sprang up a wind out of the
west, which burst the clouds, let through the sun, and set
the mill to the turning. There was something of spring in
the sunshine, or else it was in my heart; and the appearing
of the great sails one after another from behind the hill
diverted me extremely. At times I could hear a creak of the
machinery; and by half-past eight of the day Catriona
began to sing in the house. At this I would have cast my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287"></a>287</span>
hat in the air; and I thought this dreary, desert place was
like a paradise.</p>

<p>For all which, as the day drew on and nobody came near,
I began to be aware of an uneasiness that I could scarce
explain. It seemed there was trouble afoot; the sails of the
windmill, as they came up and went down over the hill, were
like persons spying; and, outside of all fancy, it was surely
a strange neighbourhood and house for a young lady to be
brought to dwell in.</p>

<p>At breakfast, which we took late, it was manifest that
James More was in some danger or perplexity; manifest
that Alan was alive to the same, and watched him close; and
this appearance of duplicity upon the one side, and vigilance
upon the other, held me on live coals. The meal was no
sooner over than James seemed to come to a resolve, and
began to make apologies. He had an appointment of a
private nature in the town (it was with the French nobleman,
he told me), and we would please excuse him till about noon.
Meanwhile, he carried his daughter aside to the far end of
the room, where he seemed to speak rather earnestly and
she to listen without much inclination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am caring less and less about this man James,&rdquo; said
Alan. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something no&rsquo; right with the man James,
and I wouldna wonder but what Alan Breck would give an
eye to him this day. I would like fine to see yon French
nobleman, Davie; and I daresay you could find an employ
to yoursel&rsquo;, and that would be to speir at the lassie for some
news of your affair. Just tell it to her plainly&mdash;tell her
ye&rsquo;re a muckle ass at the off-set; and then, if I were you,
and ye could do it naitural, I would just mint to her I was
in some kind of a danger; a&rsquo; weemen-folk likes that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I canna lee, Alan, I canna do it naitural,&rdquo; says I,
mocking him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The more fool you!&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Then ye&rsquo;ll can tell
her that I recommended it; that&rsquo;ll set her to the laughing;
and I wouldna wonder but what that was the next best.
But see to the pair of them! If I didna feel just sure of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288"></a>288</span>
lassie, and that she was awful pleased and chief with Alan,
I would think there was some kind of hocus-pocus about
yon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is she so pleased with ye, then, Alan?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She thinks a heap of me,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m no&rsquo;
like you: I&rsquo;m one that can tell. That she does&mdash;she thinks
a heap of Alan. And troth! I&rsquo;m thinking a good deal of
him mysel&rsquo;; and with your permission, Shaws, I&rsquo;ll be
getting a wee yont amang the bents, so that I can see what
way James goes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One after another went, till I was left alone beside the
breakfast-table; James to Dunkirk, Alan dogging him,
Catriona up the stairs to her own chamber. I could very
well understand how she should avoid to be alone with me;
yet was none the better pleased with it for that, and bent
my mind to entrap her to an interview before the men returned.
Upon the whole, the best appeared to me to do like
Alan. If I was out of view among the sandhills, the fine
morning would decoy her forth; and once I had her in the
open, I could please myself.</p>

<p>No sooner said than done; nor was I long under the bield
of a hillock before she appeared at the inn-door, looked here
and there, and (seeing nobody) set out by a path that led
directly seaward, and by which I followed her. I was in no
haste to make my presence known; the farther she went I
made sure of the longer hearing to my suit; and the ground
being all sandy it was easy to follow her unheard. The path
rose and came at last to the head of a knowe. Thence I had
a picture for the first time of what a desolate wilderness that
inn stood hidden in; where was no man to be seen, nor any
house of man, except just Bazin&rsquo;s and the windmill. Only a
little farther on, the sea appeared and two or three ships
upon it, pretty as a drawing. One of these was extremely
close in to be so great a vessel; and I was aware of a shock
of new suspicion, when I recognised the trim of the <i>Seahorse</i>.
What should an English ship be doing so near in to France?
Why was Alan brought into her neighbourhood, and that in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289"></a>289</span>
a place so far from any hope of rescue? and was it by accident,
or by design, that the daughter of James More should
walk that day to the seaside?</p>

<p>Presently I came forth behind her in the front of the
sandhills and above the beach. It was here long and solitary;
with a man-o&rsquo;-war&rsquo;s boat drawn up about the middle of
the prospect, and an officer in charge and pacing the sands
like one who waited. I sat immediately down where the
rough grass a good deal covered me, and looked for what
should follow. Catriona went straight to the boat; the officer
met her with civilities; they had ten words together; I saw
a letter changing hands; and there was Catriona returning.
At the same time, as if this were all her business on the Continent,
the boat shoved off and was headed for the <i>Seahorse</i>.
But I observed the officer to remain behind and disappear
among the bents.</p>

<p>I liked the business little; and, the more I considered
of it, liked it less. Was it Alan the officer was seeking? or
Catriona? She drew near with her head down, looking constantly
on the sand, and made so tender a picture that I
could not bear to doubt her innocence. The next, she
raised her face and recognised me; seemed to hesitate, and
then came on again, but more slowly, and I thought with a
changed colour. And at that thought, all else that was upon
my bosom&mdash;fears, suspicions, the care of my friend&rsquo;s life&mdash;was
clean swallowed up; and I rose to my feet and stood
waiting her in a drunkenness of hope.</p>

<p>I gave her &ldquo;good-morning&rdquo; as she came up, which she
returned with a good deal of composure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you forgive my having followed you?&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you are always meaning kindly,&rdquo; she replied;
and then, with a little outburst, &ldquo;but why will you be sending
money to that man? It must not be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never sent it for him,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but for you, as you
know well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you have no right to be sending it to either one of
us,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;David, it is not right.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page290"></a>290</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not, it is all wrong,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and I pray God He
will help this dull fellow (if it be at all possible) to make it
better. Catriona, this is no kind of life for you to lead; and
I ask your pardon for the word, but yon man is no fit father
to take care of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not be speaking of him, even!&rdquo; was her cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I need speak of him no more; it is not of him that
I am thinking&mdash;O, be sure of that!&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;I think of
the one thing. I have been alone now this long time in
Leyden; and when I was by way of at my studies, still I
was thinking of that. Next Alan came, and I went among
soldier-men to their big dinners; and still I had the same
thought. And it was the same before, when I had her there
beside me. Catriona, do you see this napkin at my throat?
You cut a corner from it once and then cast it from you.
They&rsquo;re <i>your</i> colours now; I wear them in my heart. My
dear, I cannot be wanting you. O, try to put up with me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I stepped before her so as to intercept her walking on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try to put up with me,&rdquo; I was saying, &ldquo;try and bear
with me a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still she had never the word, and a fear began to rise in
me like a fear of death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catriona,&rdquo; I cried, gazing on her hard, &ldquo;is it a mistake
again? Am I quite lost?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She raised her face to me, breathless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want me, Davie, truly?&rdquo; said she, and I scarce
could hear her say it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do that,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;O, sure you know it&mdash;I do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have nothing left to give or to keep back,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;I was all yours from the first day, if you would have had a
gift of me!&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>This was on the summit of a brae; the place was windy
and conspicuous, we were to be seen there even from the
English ship; but I kneeled down before her in the sand,
and embraced her knees, and burst into that storm of weeping
that I thought it must have broken me. All thought was
wholly beaten from my mind by the vehemency of my discomposure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291"></a>291</span>
I knew not where I was, I had forgot why I
was happy; only I knew she stooped, and I felt her cherish
me to her face and bosom, and heard her words out of a
whirl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Davie,&rdquo; she was saying, &ldquo;O, Davie, is this what you
think of me? Is it so that you were caring for poor me?
O, Davie, Davie!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that she wept also, and our tears were commingled
in a perfect gladness.</p>

<p>It might have been ten in the day before I came to a
clear sense of what a mercy had befallen me; and sitting
over against her, with her hands in mine, gazed in her face,
and laughed out loud for pleasure like a child, and called
her foolish and kind names. I have never seen the place
that looked so pretty as these bents by Dunkirk; and the
windmill sails, as they bobbed over the knowe, were like
a tune of music.</p>

<p>I know not how much longer we might have continued
to forget all else besides ourselves, had I not chanced upon
a reference to her father, which brought us to reality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My little friend,&rdquo; I was calling her again and again,
rejoicing to summon up the past by the sound of it, and to
gaze across on her, and to be a little distant&mdash;&ldquo;My little
friend, now you are mine altogether; mine for good, my
little friend; and that man&rsquo;s no longer at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There came a sudden whiteness in her face, she plucked
her hands from mine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Davie, take me away from him!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
something wrong; he&rsquo;s not true. There will be something
wrong; I have a dreadful terror here at my heart. What
will he be wanting at all events with that King&rsquo;s ship?
What will this word be saying?&rdquo; And she held the letter
forth. &ldquo;My mind misgives me, it will be some ill to Alan.
Open it, Davie&mdash;open it and see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I took it, and looked at it, and shook my head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it goes against me, I cannot open a
man&rsquo;s letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page292"></a>292</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to save your friend?&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I canna tell,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I think not. If I was only
sure!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you have but to break the seal!&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but the thing goes against
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give it here,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and I will open it myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor you neither,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;You least of all. It
concerns your father, and his honour, dear, which we are
both misdoubting. No question but the place is dangerous-like,
and the English ship being here, and your father having
word from it, and yon officer that stayed ashore! He would
not be alone either; there must be more along with him;
I daresay we are spied upon this minute. Ay, no doubt,
the letter should be opened; but somehow, not by you nor
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was about thus far with it, and my spirit very much
overcome with a sense of danger and hidden enemies, when
I spied Alan, come back again from following James, and
walking by himself among the sandhills. He was in his
soldier&rsquo;s coat, of course, and mighty fine; but I could not
avoid to shudder when I thought how little that jacket
would avail him, if he were once caught and flung in a skiff,
and carried on board of the <i>Seahorse</i>, a deserter, a rebel,
and now a condemned murderer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there is the man that has the best
right to open it: or not, as he thinks fit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With which I called upon his name, and we both stood
up to be a mark for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it is so&mdash;if it be more disgrace&mdash;will you can bear
it?&rdquo; she asked, looking upon me with a burning eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was asked something of the same question when
I had seen you but the once,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;What do you think
I answered? That if I liked you as I thought I did&mdash;and
O, but I like you better!&mdash;I would marry you at his gallows&rsquo;
foot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The blood rose in her face; she came close up and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293"></a>293</span>
pressed upon me, holding my hand: and it was so that we
awaited Alan.</p>

<p>He came with one of his queer smiles. &ldquo;What was
I telling ye, David?&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a time for all things, Alan,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and this
time is serious. How have you sped? You can speak
out plain before this friend of ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been upon a fool&rsquo;s errand,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt we have done better than you, then,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;and, at least, here is a great deal of matter that you must
judge of. Do you see that?&rdquo; I went on, pointing to the
ship. &ldquo;That is the <i>Seahorse</i>, Captain Palliser.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should ken her, too,&rdquo; says Alan. &ldquo;I had fyke
enough with her when she was stationed in the Forth. But
what ails the man to come so close?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you why he came there first,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It
was to bring this letter to James More. Why he stops here
now that it&rsquo;s delivered, what it&rsquo;s likely to be about, why
there&rsquo;s an officer hiding in the bents, and whether or not
it&rsquo;s probable that he&rsquo;s alone&mdash;I would rather you considered
for yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A letter to James More?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The same,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and I can tell ye more than that,&rdquo; said Alan.
&ldquo;For last night, when you were fast asleep, I heard the
man colloguing with some one in the French, and then the
door of that inn to be opened and shut.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alan!&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;you slept all night, and I am here
to prove it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, but I would never trust Alan whether he was
asleep or waking!&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;But the business looks
bad. Let&rsquo;s see the letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I gave it him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catriona,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;ye&rsquo;ll have to excuse me, my
dear; but there&rsquo;s nothing less than my fine bones upon the
cast of it, and I&rsquo;ll have to break this seal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is my wish,&rdquo; said Catriona.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page294"></a>294</span></p>

<p>He opened it, glanced it through, and flung his hand in
the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The stinking brock!&rdquo; says he, and crammed the paper
in his pocket. &ldquo;Here, let&rsquo;s get our things thegither. This
place is fair death to me.&rdquo; And he began to walk towards
the inn.</p>

<p>It was Catriona that spoke first. &ldquo;He has sold you?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sold me, my dear,&rdquo; said Alan. &ldquo;But thanks to you
and Davie, I&rsquo;ll can jink him yet. Just let me win upon my
horse!&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catriona must come with us,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;She can have
no more traffic with that man. She and I are to be
married.&rdquo; At which she pressed my hand to her
side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are ye there with it?&rdquo; says Alan, looking back. &ldquo;The
best day&rsquo;s work that ever either of ye did yet! And I&rsquo;m
bound to say, my dawtie, ye make a real bonny couple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The way that he was following brought us close in by
the windmill, where I was aware of a man in seaman&rsquo;s
trousers, who seemed to be spying from behind it. Only,
of course, we took him in the rear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See, Alan!&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wheesht!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is my affairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man was, no doubt, a little deafened by the clattering
of the mill, and we got up close before he noticed. Then
he turned, and we saw he was a big fellow with a mahogany
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think, sir,&rdquo; says Alan, &ldquo;that you speak the
English?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Non, monsieur</i>,&rdquo; says he, with an incredible bad
accent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Non, monsieur</i>,&rdquo; cries Alan, mocking him. &ldquo;Is that
how they learn you French on the <i>Seahorse</i>? Ye muckle,
gutsey hash, here&rsquo;s a Scots boot to your English hurdies!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And bounding on him before he could escape, he dealt
the man a kick that laid him on his nose. Then he stood,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295"></a>295</span>
with a savage smile, and watched him scramble to his feet
and scamper off into the sandhills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s high time I was clear of these empty bents!&rdquo;
said Alan; and continued his way at top speed, and we still
following, to the back-door of Bazin&rsquo;s inn.</p>

<p>It chanced that as we entered by the one door we came
face to face with James More entering by the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; said I to Catriona, &ldquo;quick! upstairs with you
and make your packets; this is no fit scene for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the meanwhile James and Alan had met in the midst
of the long room. She passed them close by to reach the
stairs; and after she was some way up I saw her turn and
glance at them again, though without pausing. Indeed,
they were worth looking at. Alan wore as they met one
of his best appearances of courtesy and friendliness, yet with
something eminently warlike, so that James smelled danger
off the man, as folk smell fire in a house, and stood prepared
for accidents.</p>

<p>Time pressed. Alan&rsquo;s situation in that solitary place,
and his enemies about him, might have daunted Cæsar.
It made no change in him; and it was in his old spirit of
mockery and daffing that he began the interview.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A braw good day to ye again, Mr. Drummond,&rdquo; said
he. &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll yon business of yours be just about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the thing being private, and rather of a long
story,&rdquo; says James, &ldquo;I think it will keep very well till we
have eaten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m none so sure of that,&rdquo; said Alan. &ldquo;It sticks in
my mind it&rsquo;s either now or never; for the fact is me and
Mr. Balfour here have gotten a line, and we&rsquo;re thinking of
the road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I saw a little surprise in James&rsquo;s eye; but he held himself
stoutly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have but the one word to say to cure you of that,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;and that is the name of my business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say it, then,&rdquo; says Alan. &ldquo;Hout! wha minds for
Davie?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page296"></a>296</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a matter that would make us both rich men,&rdquo;
said James.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do ye tell me that?&rdquo; cries Alan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, sir,&rdquo; said James. &ldquo;The plain fact is that it is
Cluny&rsquo;s Treasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Alan. &ldquo;Have ye got word of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ken the place, Mr. Stewart, and can take you there,&rdquo;
said James.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This crowns all!&rdquo; says Alan. &ldquo;Well, and I&rsquo;m glad
I came to Dunkirk. And so this was your business, was
it? Halvers, I&rsquo;m thinking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the business, sir,&rdquo; says James.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; says Alan; and then in the same tone of
childlike interest, &ldquo;it has naething to do with the <i>Seahorse</i>,
then?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With what?&rdquo; says James.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or the lad that I have just kicked the bottom of behind
yon windmill?&rdquo; pursued Alan. &ldquo;Hut, man! have
done with your lees! I have Palliser&rsquo;s letter here in my
pouch.&mdash;You&rsquo;re by with it, James More. You can never
show your face again with dacent folk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>James was taken all aback with it. He stood a second,
motionless and white, then swelled with the living anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you talk to me, you bastard?&rdquo; he roared out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye glee&rsquo;d swine!&rdquo; cried Alan, and hit him a sounding
buffet in the mouth, and the next wink of time their blades
clashed together.</p>

<p>At the first sound of the bare steel I instinctively leaped
back from the collision. The next I saw, James parried
a thrust so nearly that I thought him killed; and it lowed
up in my mind that this was the girl&rsquo;s father, and in a
manner almost my own, and I drew and ran in to sever
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep back, Davie! Are ye daft? Damn ye, keep
back!&rdquo; roared Alan. &ldquo;Your blood be on your ain heid
then!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I beat their blades down twice. I was knocked reeling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297"></a>297</span>
against the wall; I was back again betwixt them. They
took no heed of me, thrusting at each other like two furies.
I can never think how I avoided being stabbed myself or
stabbing one of these two Rodomonts, and the whole business
turned about me like a piece of a dream; in the midst
of which I heard a great cry from the stair, and Catriona
sprang before her father. In the same moment the point
of my sword encountered something yielding. It came
back to me reddened. I saw the blood flow on the girl&rsquo;s
kerchief, and stood sick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you be killing him before my eyes, and me his
daughter after all?&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, I have done with him,&rdquo; said Alan, and went
and sat on a table, with his arms crossed and the sword
naked in his hand.</p>

<p>A while she stood before the man, panting, with big
eyes, then swung suddenly about and faced him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Begone!&rdquo; was her word, &ldquo;take your shame out of
my sight; leave me with clean folk. I am a daughter of
Alpin! Shame of the sons of Alpin, begone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was said with so much passion as awoke me from
the horror of my own bloodied sword. The two stood
facing, she with the red stain on her kerchief, he white as
a rag. I knew him well enough&mdash;I knew it must have
pierced him in the quick place of his soul; but he betook
himself to a bravado air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says he, sheathing his sword, though still with
a bright eye on Alan, &ldquo;if this brawl is over I will but get
my portmanteau&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There goes no pockmantie out of this place except
with me!&rdquo; says Alan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; cries James.</p>

<p>&ldquo;James More,&rdquo; says Alan, &ldquo;this lady daughter of yours
is to marry my friend Davie, upon the which account I let
you pack with a hale carcase. But take you my advice of
it and get that carcase out of harm&rsquo;s way or ower late.
Little as you suppose it, there are leemits to my temper.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page298"></a>298</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Be damned, sir, but my money&rsquo;s there!&rdquo; said James.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m vexed about that too,&rdquo; says Alan, with his funny
face, &ldquo;but now, ye see, it&rsquo;s mine&rsquo;s.&rdquo; And then with more
gravity, &ldquo;Be you advised, James More, you leave this
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>James seemed to cast about for a moment in his mind;
but it&rsquo;s to be thought he had enough of Alan&rsquo;s swordsmanship,
for he suddenly put off his hat to us and (with a face
like one of the damned) bade us farewell in a series. With
which he was gone.</p>

<p>At the same time a spell was lifted from me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catriona,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;it was me&mdash;it was my sword.
O, are ye much hurt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it, Davie, I am loving you for the pain of it;
it was done defending that bad man, my father. See!&rdquo;
she said, and showed me a bleeding scratch, &ldquo;see, you have
made a man of me now. I will carry a wound like an old
soldier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joy that she should be so little hurt, and the love of her
brave nature, transported me. I embraced her, I kissed
the wound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And am I to be out of the kissing, me that never lost
a chance?&rdquo; says Alan; and putting me aside and taking
Catriona by either shoulder, &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
a true daughter of Alpin. By all accounts, he was a very
fine man, and he may weel be proud of you. If ever I was
to get married, it&rsquo;s the marrow of you I would be seeking
for a mother to my sons. And I bear a king&rsquo;s name and
speak the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said it with a serious heat of admiration that was
honey to the girl, and, through her, to me. It seemed to
wipe us clean of all James More&rsquo;s disgraces. And the next
moment he was just himself again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now by your leave, my dawties,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this
is a&rsquo; very bonny; but Alan Breck&rsquo;ll be a wee thing nearer
to the gallows than he&rsquo;s caring for; and, Dod! I think this
is a grand place to be leaving.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page299"></a>299</span></p>

<p>The word recalled us to some wisdom. Alan ran upstairs
and returned with our saddle-bags and James More&rsquo;s
portmanteau; I picked up Catriona&rsquo;s bundle where she had
dropped it on the stair; and we were setting forth out of
that dangerous house, when Bazin stopped the way with
cries and gesticulations. He had whipped under a table
when the swords were drawn, but now he was as bold as a
lion. There was his bill to be settled, there was a chair
broken, Alan had sat among his dinner things, James More
had fled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;pay yourself,&rdquo; and flung him down
some Lewie d&rsquo;ors; for I thought it was no time to be
accounting.</p>

<p>He sprang upon that money, and we passed him by, and
ran forth into the open. Upon three sides of the house
were seamen hasting and closing in; a little nearer to us
James More waved his hat as if to hurry them; and right
behind him, like some foolish person holding up its hands,
were the sails of the windmill turning.</p>

<p>Alan gave but the one glance, and laid himself down
to run. He carried a great weight in James More&rsquo;s portmanteau;
but I think he would as soon have lost his life
as cast away that booty which was his revenge; and he
ran so that I was distressed to follow him, and marvelled
and exulted to see the girl bounding at my side.</p>

<p>As soon as we appeared, they cast off all disguise upon
the other side; and the seamen pursued us with shouts and
view-hullohs. We had a start of some two hundred yards,
and they were but bandy-legged tarpaulins after all, that
could not hope to better us at such an exercise. I suppose
they were armed, but did not care to use their pistols on
French ground. And as soon as I perceived that we not
only held our advantage, but drew a little away, I began
to feel quite easy of the issue. For all which, it was a hot,
brisk bit of work, so long as it lasted; Dunkirk was still
far off; and when we popped over a knowe, and found a
company of the garrison marching on the other side on some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300"></a>300</span>
man&oelig;uvre, I could very well understand the word that
Alan had.</p>

<p>He stopped running at once; and mopping at his
brow, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re a real bonny folk, the French nation,&rdquo;
says he.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page301"></a>301</span></p>

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">No</span> sooner were we safe within the walls of Dunkirk than
we held a very necessary council of war on our position.
We had taken a daughter from her father at the sword&rsquo;s
point; any judge would give her back to him at once, and
by all likelihood clap me and Alan into gaol; and though
we had an argument upon our side in Captain Palliser&rsquo;s
letter, neither Catriona nor I were very keen to be using
it in public. Upon all accounts it seemed the most prudent
to carry the girl to Paris, to the hands of her own chieftain,
Macgregor of Bohaldie, who would be very willing to help
his kinswoman on the one hand, and not at all anxious to
dishonour James upon the other.</p>

<p>We made but a slow journey of it up, for Catriona was
not so good at the riding as the running, and had scarce
sat in a saddle since the &rsquo;Forty-five. But we made it out
at last, reached Paris early of a Sabbath morning, and
made all speed, under Alan&rsquo;s guidance, to find Bohaldie.
He was finely lodged, and lived in a good style, having a
pension on the Scots Fund, as well as private means; greeted
Catriona like one of his own house, and seemed altogether
very civil and discreet, but not particularly open. We
asked of the news of James More. &ldquo;Poor James!&rdquo; said he,
and shook his head and smiled, so that I thought he knew
further than he meant to tell. Then we showed him
Palliser&rsquo;s letter, and he drew a long face at that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor James!&rdquo; said he again. &ldquo;Well, there are
worse folk than James More too. But this is dreadful
bad. Tut, tut, he must have forgot himself entirely! This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302"></a>302</span>
is a most undesirable letter. But, for all that, gentlemen,
I cannot see what we would want to make it public for.
It&rsquo;s an ill bird that fouls his own nest, and we are all Scots
folk, and all Hieland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon this we were all agreed, save perhaps Alan; and
still more upon the question of our marriage, which Bohaldie
took in his own hands, as though there had been no such
person as James More, and gave Catriona away with very
pretty manners and agreeable compliments in French. It
was not till all was over, and our healths drunk, that he
told us James was in that city, whither he had preceded us
some days, and where he now lay sick, and like to die. I
thought I saw by my wife&rsquo;s face what way her inclination
pointed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And let us go see him, then,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it is your pleasure,&rdquo; said Catriona. These were
early days.</p>

<p>He was lodged in the same quarter of the city with his
chief, in a great house upon a corner; and we were guided
up to the garret where he lay by the sound of Highland
piping. It seemed he had just borrowed a set of them
from Bohaldie to amuse his sickness; though he was no
such hand as was his brother Rob, he made good music of
the kind; and it was strange to observe the French folk
crowding on the stairs, and some of them laughing. He
lay propped in a pallet. The first look of him I saw he was
upon his last business; and, doubtless, this was a strange
place for him to die in. But even now I find I can scarce
dwell upon his end with patience. Doubtless, Bohaldie
had prepared him; he seemed to know we were married,
complimented us on the event, and gave us a benediction
like a patriarch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been never understood,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I forgive
you both without an afterthought&rdquo;; after which he spoke
for all the world in his old manner, was so obliging as to
play us a tune or two upon his pipes, and borrowed a small
sum before I left. I could not trace even a hint of shame
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303"></a>303</span>
in any part of his behaviour; but he was great upon forgiveness;
it seemed always fresh to him. I think he forgave
me every time we met; and when after some four days
he passed away in a kind of odour of affectionate sanctity,
I could have torn my hair out for exasperation. I had him
buried; but what to put upon his tomb was quite beyond
me, till at last I considered the date would look best alone.</p>

<p>I thought it wiser to resign all thoughts of Leyden, where
we had appeared once as brother and sister, and it would
certainly look strange to return in a new character. Scotland
would be doing for us; and thither, after I had recovered
that which I had left behind, we sailed in a Low
Country ship.</p>

<p>And now, Miss Barbara Balfour (to set the ladies first),
and Mr. Alan Balfour, younger of Shaws, here is the story
brought fairly to an end. A great many of the folk that
took a part in it you will find (if you think well) that you
have seen and spoken with. Alison Hastie in Limekilns
was the lass that rocked your cradle when you were too
small to know of it, and walked abroad with you in the
policy when you were bigger. That very fine great lady
that is Miss Barbara&rsquo;s name-mamma is no other than the
same Miss Grant that made so much a fool of David Balfour
in the house of the Lord Advocate. And I wonder whether
you remember a little, lean, lively gentleman in a scratch-wig
and a wraprascal, that came to Shaws very late of a
dark night, and whom ye were awakened out of your beds
and brought down to the dining-hall to be presented to,
by the name of Mr. Jamieson? Or has Alan forgotten what
he did at Mr. Jamieson&rsquo;s request&mdash;a most disloyal act&mdash;for
which, by the letter of the law, he might be hanged&mdash;no
less than drinking the king&rsquo;s health <i>across the water</i>? These
were strange doings in a good Whig house! But Mr.
Jamieson is a man privileged, and might set fire to my corn-barn;
and the name they know him by now in France is
the Chevalier Stewart.</p>

<p>As for Davie and Catriona, I shall watch you pretty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304"></a>304</span>
close in the next days, and see if you are so bold as to be
laughing at papa and mamma. It is true we were not so
wise as we might have been, and made a great deal of sorrow
out of nothing; but you will find as you grow up that even
the artful Miss Barbara, and even the valiant Mr. Alan,
will be not so very much wiser than their parents. For the
life of man upon this world of ours is a funny business.
They talk of the angels weeping; but I think they must
more often be holding their sides, as they look on; and there
was one thing I determined to do when I began this long
story, and that was to tell out everything as it befell.</p>
